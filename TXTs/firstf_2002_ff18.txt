Alabama Moratorium
Here in what has been an incredibly patient South, it's decision time. Invaded from the border by unassimilable foreigners, from the NY-DC empire by its latest War on Self-Government, and from within by the media, we've had it; and I will not bend nor blend further. Those one-foot-in-a-huckct utopian atheists \ haven't a clue. As this heritage movement continues rolling along unconcerned with their faltering attempts using censorship and misrepresentations to keep us divided and conquered, we shall communicate mainly via email and in newly flourishing conservative periodicals. The internet is our miracle.
Alabama's Moratorium Day is to immediately follow Tax Freedom Day, which will be declared for around the middle of April, 2003 - the date on which our entire labors no longer go to Leviathan. Here's the layout. Those of the vanguard must suffer zero taxes or interest during 24 hours of withdrawal from the enforced union. We shall use this day to recall our state's true and unsullied history while expressing Alabama's hopes and prayers for the future.
Thfrlf lu fw mn tfrtterfy wfrhdniwaf ftir one day oniyrNvnratni to wttfifmUS or
pay taxes during that moratorium, nor accepting charges and penalties after the fact, we remind our elected officials that they looked the other way when civil disobedience was dictated by the mediacracy (and let us inform the latter that they're no longer in charge).
Send your considered input on the idea for publication and further discussion. No hurry. Having been on this downhill slide since Ape Linkum, we've sufficient time.

NAACP needs news, media oblige
shut down the mall, ransacking stores of the usual TV sets and cases of beer; and then, to top it all off, demanded and got the Eight Flags Display removed as a condition for leaving town - because, among those banners having governed this coast at one time or another was Whitey’s hated Battle Flag. That compromise alone, among all of this, made the news back then.
And now the board of supervisors having shown courage by hoisting the flag display again, those media went courting the horde's return; this time with the supposedly respectable NAACP.
But Vincent Breeding, National Director for the Europcan-Amcrican Unity and Rights Organization (EURO), came now in support of the Harrison County supervisors and locals reftiscd to be intimidated again by such types The police, too, were better prepared, making quick arrests
So which group do you think the media singled out to be the extremists, the villains, the culprits, the radicals? Need we state the obvious?

Jim Giles demanded to know of them, for instance, why a week earlier the media had rushed to interview and quote at length a handful of NAACP types protesting the Harrison County Commission's decision to put back up their Eight Flags Display.
“If that vote by elected representatives of the people living in this county had gone the other way, and we came demonstrating against its removal, you wouldn't be here!" said Giles to the media. As Giles corrected their twisted ideas of what the Confederate Flag represents today by naming patriotism, morality and pride, a reporter scribbled on his pad “Supremacist pride.” Asked by one scrutinizing over his shoulder why he had added Supremacist, which wasn't spoken by Mr. Giles, “Get your finger off my pad,” growled the mediacrat.

2 The Fir*t Freedom August 2002	— A different slant on the news	—
HERE’S WHAT WAS IGNORED OR MISREPORTED ELSEWHERE
M&M, NAACP and NCAA: three peecees in a pod
NOT ONE, BUT TWO of the fourteen “tali ships? in the parade of sail carried the battle flag in salute to Mobile. The Meka II, captained by Horatio Sinbad, (legal name) out of Beaufort, North Carolina, docked just astern of the Coast Guard Ship Eagle, and continued to fly the battle flag on Thursday, July 4th through Saturday. On Sunday, while Captain Sinbad was ashore, a representative of the Tricentennial Commissariat came onboard and instructed the officer of the watch that orders came from the highest level of the Tricentennial Commissariat (Ann Bedsole) saying the flag had to come down now “or else." The officer complied. Captain Sinbad and the officer of the other ship were heard to say if he had been onboard, they would have raised anchor and left Mobile in their wake. This was a tragically misguided way to treat a guest of the city of Mobile, not to mention a culturally-bigoted order.
NASTY NAACP. South Carolina's two percent tax on accommodations collected S29 million from June 1,2001, to May 31. The tax income, key indicator of the industry's health, was up 1.S percent from the same period the year before, when the battle flag came down. The state's retreat before the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People makes little sense, even dollaf-wisc, except to the fund raisers for thgt defunct cause. (Can it be they don't relish the idea of working for a living?) "When we look at those numbers, we can't really find an impact of the boycott," said Marion Edmonds, spokesman for the S.C. Department of Parks, Recreation and Tourism. So why not stop sucking up to nasty NAACP?
RAINING TEARS IN GEORGIA. No one of the scalawag* who voted to replace that state's flag with a peccee rag can show his or her face in public without the flagging receptions they deserve. “Lijah” and company go affer them wherever they show, and have made many trips to the Governor's mansion. As they keep handing out propaganda and registering voters at booths all across Georgia, Governor “King Roy" Barnes, who said the flag issue would be forgotten before next election, may be registering second thoughts. These patriots also install poles flying real Georgia flags on private properties along highways and interstates, to date over 650 of them, fewer than 5% having been stolen or vandalized.
PEECEE IGNORANCE. Robert Forkuer went for his Alabama SCV car tag but was told to prove' he belonged to the Sons of Confederate Veterans before he could buy one. Summoning the tag officer’s superior, it was established that, yes, he can; vanity tags not only advertise, but part of their cost goes to, the sponsoring organization. Such minor apparatchiks want to censor the word Dixie and other symbols that lack TV approval- A national civil liberties group is doggedly seeking an explanation from the state Division of Motor Vehicles over its refusal to issue a special license plate to the West Virginia chapter of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, hinting that if content is the holdup, the Rutherford Institute will be taking the DMV to court
ISRAELIS LEAVING “PROMISED LAND” for Germany - the country that puts them in gas ovens? Germany is seeing increased applications for citizenship from Israelis, perhaps due to growing fears for Middle East security. The country may process over 3,000 requests by year's end, an increase from the 1,751 in 2001, which was also a rise over the preceding year. The Nazis having revoked the citizenship of that country's 600,000 Jews in 1941,anew German constitution drawn up in 1949 enshrines the right of all those people -mostly “killed in the Holocaust” -and their
descendants to reclaim their citizenship. But, if there were only 600,000 Jews in wartime Germany, most of them supposedly killed in the big H, where did those other 5,400,000 hail from? Whithersoever thou goest, thy Schicksal geht mit
NUTTY CENSORS OF ATHLETIC APPELLATIONS. That’s right, it's no longer the National Collegiate Athletic Association. The NCAA, having fussed over those evil Indian and Confederate names, may be planning next to urge deliberately losing games, since winning suggests 6dat — and that rhymes with hate (sort of). Having accused the people of Mississippi and South Carolina for the design of their flags of intimidating those bulks of (presumably black) college athletes, all this sensitivity was bound to come home to roost. Oops, that suggests chicken, and we can't offend El Dubya’s voters at Tyson's. Anyway, after locking itself up for six weeks of reeducation, the NCAA is introducing its new, improved mascot - an untoasted marshmallow.
WE’RE AN ENDANGERED SPECIES. Last December, when The Washington Times documented rabid environmentalists setting traps for our further taming under the peccee yoke, such culprits should've at least lost their government jobs. Some of those 500 (!) “scientists” studying Canada lynx in the United States had submitted six false fur samples from a captive lynx and a stuffed bobcat named Old Henry, baiting “scratching posts” in the woods from which to gather fur that could then be analyzed by a DNA laboratory in Montana. Thus, false data had been collected in order to get this lynx included on the Endangered Species List for an area where it didn’t even exist, a deception meant to expand an unthreatened army of government snoopervisors.
UNBELIEVABLE BUT TRUE . . . Eighty percent of the 1,200 airport screeners working for three contractors in San Francisco are not U.S. citizens, Daz Lamparas of Service Employees International Union admits, having told NewsMax.com: “citizenship status has nothing to do with work performance." The situation was dismal as recently as 1999, he said, with annual turnover of screening personnel topping 200 percent Then the city implemented a quality standard program that established higher wages with medical insurance, vacation accruals and a union contract The turnover rate is now less than 15 percent, Lamparas said. None of the immigrants are working illegally, he added. They all have green cards, and 200 of them qualify for naturalization, he said. More than 400 of them have not lived in the country the four years and nine months required to apply for naturalization. The majority of them came to California from the Philippines - where Muslim terrorists are active.
GLOBALISTS WORMING INTO “AZTLAN.” Mexico is rapidly being taken over by the Zionists, President Vicente Fox of the Partido Accion Nacional (PAN) having defeated the Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI) which had been in power since the Mexican Revolution or for about 72 years. Here’s the latest clue. A letter from career diplomat Ismael Orozco Guzm&n to the Mexico City daily Excilsior complains that Secretary of Foreign Relations Jorge Castaneda Gutman has been purging longtime career diplomats of the Secretaria de Relaciones Exteriores (SRE) and replacing them with his Zionist cohorts. Guzm&n pleads on his behalf and for four other career diplomats, Eduardo Cervera Camara, Luis Garcia, Antonio Lc6n Zarate and Eduardo Cervera Limaza, all five having previously complained that the Jewish Secretary had bypassed them for deserved promotions and instead was
appointing his Zionist cohorts to what should have been their positions.
DON’T WANT TO BE “MODERN" if it means being tracked like a criminal? Then tell your congressman to oppose the “Driver's License Modernization Act of 2002" (H.R. 4633), which would establish a nationwide identification system through the bureaucratic back door of state driver's licenses, requiring each state to standardize its licenses and identification cards within five years. Is there any reason for state governments if this passes? More papers demanded by Big Bro, and more counterfeiting of the same by illegals, means less freedom for you and me.
NUCLEAR WASTING TWO STATES. And, with the vote always 48 to 2 (in terms of states, that is), there's nothing Nevada and South Carolina can do about being ovemiled by those producing the stuff. It has to go somewhere, they say. The federal government owns nearly eighty percent of the state of Nevada. Yes, eighty percent, as in eight out of every ten acres. While the governor of South Carolina has aired radio ads claiming he will not back down in the face of federal bureaucrats, he offers no specific plan for resistance.
PUNDIT CAN'T HEAR WELL. Lt. CoL Michael Guthrie, a Virginia Military Institute alumni and member of the Tennessee Army National Guard, when asked by the reporter, denied that the new four-year private military institute planned for Bedford County, Tennessee, was to be Confederate oriented. But the story didn't come out that way. Why are the media grasping at straws to stop this new, all-male academy? Says Guthrie:
“In 1996-97, there were IOI women's
colleges in the U.S. and only five all-male colleges. There are three all-male colleges left in the U.S. today, and there are zero all-male military colleges in the U.S.” And, duh, that's the number those new world orderlies hope to maintain.
ONE WAY TO REWRITE HISTORY is by throwing it on the street. Uncertainties over who owns the Confederate Museum's building in New Orleans which for the past 111 years has housed its collection of Civil War memorabilia were tentatively settled July 19 by Civil District Judge C. Hunter King's having it belong to the University of New Orleans Foundation. They want it for their new Ogden Museum of Southern Art, and UNO claims the Confederate Museum's building, a Romanesque revival structure by architect Thomas Sully, never belonged to Memorial Hall Museum, Inc., that the UNO Foundation bought the site in December 2000 from Howard Memorial Library Association, original owner of the old library building next to the Confederate Museum. As his ruling will probably be appealed, we’ll save that judge's spot in our Gallery of Scalawags for later.
SOVIET AMERIKA. It's known as Operation Tips (Terrorism Information and Prevention System). Local meter readers, businesses, cable TV adjusters, postal workers, delivery truck drivers, doormen and such are being sought by Justice Department officials hoping to recruit one million participants for their “eyes and ears" of America - a domestic security army in the country's ten major cities. As just reported by the London Telegraph, they're looking for workers whose “routines are ideally suited to help in the anti-terrorism effort because they allow them to recognise unusual events." Adds U.S. Rep. Ron Paul: “Congressional oversight of administrative agencies (consider the Treasury department and its renegade IRS) is nonexistent. The Justice department almost certainly will seek another way to
implement the program, with or without congressional approval."
THE POSSE COMITATUS ACT, passed in 1878 to end military prosecution of civil law in the conquered South, was to have closed the dictatorship that began with Reconstruction. But now U.S. Senator Joseph Biden Jr. (D) of Delaware is all for re-empowering soldiers to arrest American civilians. Biden and Sen. Sam Nunn (D), Georgia, had already wanted to alter the Posse Comitatus Act affer the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Building in OKC.
It may be time for local sheriffs and police chiefs to formulate contingency plans for arresting berserk politicians. We have had enough “police actions” by Washington's warriors, from Korea to Kabul - guarding everyone’s borders except our own.
SELMA ROSE and her compatriots at city hall may be in trouble. They do not want to talk about charges brought against the City of Selma by Friends of Forrest, a group denied equal protection of law when the city failed to prosecute vandals of the CSA Gen. Nathan Forrest monument Rose Sanders, wife of a state senator, is accused of having incited a Black mob’s desecration of the general’i stone likeness, the district attorney of nonfeasance for ignoring that incident The city then compounded its problems, pacifying those vandals by relocating the monument Mobile's U.S. District Judge Brevard Hand having refused the City of Selma’s plea to dismiss four essential charges. Judge Kristi Lee on July 25 set the case for July 7,2003 in Mobile before a jury selected from the entire district
THE TIM MEADOWS CASE - He’s the one who carried a Confederate Flag in the 2001 Veterans Day Parade in Mobile -is scheduled for jury trial in that city on September 9, 2002, when all of us will

attorney Charles Yow is working now on a constitutionally based motion to dismiss, which will be submitted the second week of August; so don't make plans to be there on September 9 just yet, as Mr. Yow says it’s doubtful Tim will be tried on that date.
TO KILL A CONSTITUTION. On July 15 the first of four public hearings was held in Huntsville by an assemblage hoping to cancel the amendment process and proclaim a New Alabama Order. The Huntsville Tunes sent its agent, who wrote next day what could as easily have been invented at his desk, i.e., by taking a swipe at our state's 1901 charter which “scholars say is the nation's longest and oldest state constitution..." Yeah, sure, except for Delaware 1897, Kentucky 1891, Arkansas 1874, Tennessee 1870, Iowa 1857, Ohio 1851, New Hampshire 1783, New Jersey 1776, the list goes on~. Watch it, Huntsville Times, or you'll get replaced by a responsible newspaper. This Kommission plans more sessions: in Birmingham Sept. 9, Mobile Oct 21 and in the Auburn-Opelika area Dec. 9.
ALWAYS COMPLAINING PEOPLE Led by outside instigators of another black protest challenging the democratic will of local citizens who dared to put their public beach flag display back up including the Confederate Flag, on July 27 they came; as the NAACP had promised they would: more than 500 of them bused in and filling up the Biloxi/Gulfport boardwalk. “We won't stop until that flag drops,” was how the Associated Press quoted its frontline trooper and complainer, the Rev. Charles White, in agonizing over the flag he urges all Blacks to hate. Harrison County's elected board of supervisors voted in May to return the eight flags taken down two years ago amid protests. After 9-11 the county had again hoisted the American Flags but not those eight smaller ones that flew earlier below them. The AP/NAACP coterie, however, met “equal” resolve by counter-demonstrators from EURO.

By Ellen Williams
President. The Alabama Coalition
Since March 5,2001, citizens interested in preserving accurate, unrevised history (particularly Confederate archives) here have attended all of the Alabama Historical Commission’s meetings, which are held at various locations around the state. During his employment as executive director of the AHC, Mr. Lee Warner has unveiled plan after plan to ’’reinterpret” Alabama’s historic sites, and. in particular| those with major Confederate historical significance In late February he announced his Capitol Renovations Project and said he would hold a public forum for “input” at the auditorium in the capitol on March 5, 2001. He was met by 250 citizens from all regions of the state who were more than mildly upset by Warner’s “concept” for the capitol. Faced with a barrage of queries from those waiting in line to speak, Mr. Warner’s question and answer forum turned into a session of questions-only from citizens, and a stonewalling by the director.
To date, although he is on record to do so, Warner has never held another public forum on his Capitol Renovations Project. And in spite of request after request from concerned citizens who attend every AHC meeting, he hasn’t yet revealed the actual detailed plans for the capitol. In fact, the official minutes of the Alabama Historical Commission show several commissioners themselves have not even seen the final concept after repeatedly asking for these plans.
Many heritage organizations and interested citizens have participated with the SOCCI (Save Our Capitol Citizens Initiative) committee in this effort to preserve the historical integrity of the Cradle of the Confederacy, which is on the National Register as a National Historic Landmark at the National Park Service in the U.S. Department of the Interior. Warner’s original plans would have:
■	created an amphitheater and park in front of the capitol dedicated to the Selma to Montgomery march;
■	bulldozed down the historic slopes in front of this birthplace of a nation; and
■	moved the statues of President Jefferson Davis and Confederate John Allen Wyeth from in front of the capitol to be replaced by memorials to various individuals of the march.
Now Mr. Warner (a resident of this state for years) has his sights on the home of Alabama's General Fightin' Joe Wheeler in Lawrence County. SOCCI members began an intensive investigation of the
Wheeler site on June 6th and they are still uncovering facts. Here’s the situation up until now.
1.	The official name has been changed from Joseph Wheeler Plantation to “Pond Spring, home of General Joseph Wheeler.”
Now this seems innocuous at first reading, but in all present advertising including at site, in print and on the internet. General Wheeler’s home is referred to by the shortened title, J“Pond Spring.”
2.	It’s mostly invention. Though the newest structure on the place is the homeF which General Wheeler built there in the 1870s, Mr. Warner and apparently the rubber-stamp commission plan to “restore and reinterpret” this historical treasure into a 1930*s motif.
This is the Master Plan for
the Wheeler site, to be paid for with a S250,000 federal grant from “Save America’s Treasures” - on whose board Ms. Hillary Rodham Clinton sits.
3.	Just another old Alabama farm without Joseph Wheeler’s association; he is being de-emphasized, according to Kara Kenney of AHC, in order for Mr. Warner to “tell all the stories.” All the stories include:
■	a pre-historic interpretation,
■	a slave interpretation.
■	a Sherrod House interpretation (i.e., the general's in-laws) and
■	a tenant farmer interpretation.
General Wheeler will be “interpreted”
through the eyes of his daughter Annie, who came to live at Wheeler Plantation in 1906 when her father died. The most recent issue of AHC’s publication. Preservation Report, exposes Lee Warner’s attachment to Miss Annie: “They (Annie Wheeler and her sisters) were pioneers in the early feminist movement. . .” The agenda is unmasked!
4.	The general is demoted. Through interviews with AHC staff and Dr. Mildred Caudle (who did the research), SOCCI investigators have concluded that General Wheeler’s Confederate service (without which he would have been an unknown) will be heavily underplayed; his Spanish-American service and peerless record as a U.S. Congressman being emphasized instead. And so Alabama's premier Fightin* Joe Wheeler will
**• Rre»*
Please understand that SOCCI does not have a problem with General Wheeler’s Spanish-A men can service for which all Alabamians are justly proud. We are most assuredly equally satisfied with his congressional record, where he read every bill and voted as an independent affirmatively on bills sponsored by Democrats and Republicans alike. Joseph Wheeler is unquestionably “a great American.”
REINTERPRETING: While demoting CSA General Fightin’ Joe

be presented
American.”
Both of the above historical epochs of the general’s life should be interpreted at his home in Lawrence County because they are accurate history. But anyone who does not have an agenda in interpreting the history of this great man has to be cognizant that the legend of Joseph Wheeler and his place in history was made in the Confederate States Army, where he is renowned to be one of the CSA s finest cavalry leaders.
Fort Morgan will be next. Several hundred thousand dollars have already been spent to “study” this pristine South Alabama historical treasure. In my interview with Mr. Mark Driscoll, staffer, who heads the Properties Committee for AHC,
I learned that Warner's plans are for Fort Morgan to become a commercial site not only in support of the fort, but also to pump money into the other historic Alabama sites. “We know they won’t all be self-supporting,” he said. Fort Morgan is a large enough historical site so that moneymaking additions can be placed on its
hallowed ground*, not onfry dancroo^, «*.
historically but disturbing the presently peaceful, serene atmosphere of the site.

Pledge your allegiance to God, not
Francis Bellamy (1855 -1931), a Baptist minister, wrote the original Pledge in August 1892. He was a Christian Socialist In his Pledge, he is expressing the ideas of his first cousin, Edward Bellamy, author of the American socialist utopian novels, Looking Backward (1888) and Equality (1897).
—DrJohn W. Baer
By Lloyd A. Caperton
Bellamy accepted the task of writing a new pledge which would promote the ideas of nationalism, patriotism, and socialism. The pledge was first recited before a large crowd at the 1892 Chicago Worlds Fair. The pledge was said fascist style, with outstretched arm. The pledge was soon approved and adopted by Upham, Ford, and the National Educational Association. Many think of the Pledge of Allegiance as representing traditional Americanism. Nothing could be further from the truth!
The founding fathers did not intend the U.S. to be “one nation,” but a union of nation states. The U.S. was once called “these United States,” not the United States. According to the U.S. Constitution, any state had the right to secede if that state believed the union was not in the best interest of the sovereign state. Therefore we were not meant to be “indivisible”
either. The wording which Bellamy used in the writing of his pledge was intended to weld together the mentality of all Americans, especially Southerners, in their allegiance to a centralised federal government. It was only a slight variation of Lincoln’s “Oath of Allegiance.”
Bellamy’s “Liberty and Justice for all” was really a substitute phrase which he felt forced to use instead of his preference, “Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity,” the atheist slogan of the French Revolution. When Hitler came along, he used the outstretched arm in a Nazi salute, so the hand over the heart replaced the fascist style salute for the U.S. Pledge. Many still did not want to recite the Pledge, so in 1954 during the era of Joe McCarthy, the “under God” part was added.
To pledge indivisible loyalty to any government would have been an alien concept to the founding fathers, because they knew that the idea of America itself was built upon secession from tyrants. Thomas Jefferson said that if a government no longer suits the needs of a people, it is the duty of that people to replace that government with a new government. The allegiance of Christians and Southrons should be to God and the Constitution, not to Big Brother. If you feel the need to recite a pledge, why not pledge to the Alabama State Flag. That pledge was written by Alabamians for Alabamians. “Flag of Alabama, I salute thee, to thee I
U.S. Government
pledge my allegiance, my service, and my life.”
If our rights are to be defended, it will have to be done at the state and local level.
I assure you, it won’t be done at the federal level. God is being, and will be, removed from everything - if the New Word Order controlled Federal Government has it way. The Pledge worked all too well, it was a victim of its own success; we are under socialism. The things they plan to do next you won’t believe, not even while they are doing them! They will before too long have a new pledge to the “World Government” which you'll be asked to recite. That is, unless you are an extremist, a terrorist, or a troublemaker who refuses. Then they will have a place for you!
Give your allegiance to God, not the Government. He will protect you as He has protected me! Until next time, take care.
Dixie Forever!	□

and rightly, covered them with insurance. He made a pile of money in 30 days. Two weeks prior to 9-11 an Israeli shipping company, owned approximately 45% by the Israeli Government, suddenly broke its lease and moved out of the WTC, paying a stiff penalty although not as costly as if they had remained in the building. But the big question is: Who stands to gain the most from the tragedy? No possible answer other than - “Israel.**
That leads to the final question: Why has the United States government not conducted an investigation as to the cause, and to identify the blame? It is simply because wealthy international bankers having strong ties to Israel control our newspapers, TV, and Congress!
You might recall the deliberate Israeli assault on a U.S. Navy Intelligence Ship, the USS Liberty, off the coast of Israel in 1967. We had 34 sailors killed and 171 wounded by that aggression. The ship was there to help guard Israel from a surprise attack. The U.S. Congress has never conducted an investigation as to the reasons for the Israelis attacking the ship. It may turn out that “our ally** is not the ally they would like us to believe it is.
Every piece of modem weaponry which we provide to the Israelis winds up being sold to the Chinese communists. Is that the action of an ally? Not in my book.
Will I support a war against Iraq? Not for an instant! Not until the above questions are answered.
As for my Jewish friends, I hope you know I am not anti-Jewish. I suspect you would feel as I do had the U.S. Government been giving the Pope S3 billion a year for the past 50 years to maintain peace in Northern Ireland. There is no peace in Ireland any more than there is in Israel. It is just another sink-hole for our tax dollars, and 1 suspect that the money is being used under the table^? contrary to the wishes of the American citizens — to control the actions of our Congress.
Then to make matters even worse, the Chinese are preparing for war with the U.S.
In their Five Year Plan issued in year 2000 they forecast a major war, with the most likely enemy being the United States. They will see a window of opportunity the minute we become involved in Iraq. I would imagine that the North Koreans will see the same opportunity and attack South Korea. To put it mildly, our military are not prepared for a war of that magnitude.
I will support our soldiers in the event of a war with Iraq, but not this bribable government. I consider our present rulers to be corrupt for many solid reasons; but, for this particular subject, the influence of the Bilderbergs in support of Israel is more than enough.	□
— Setting the record straight —
Letter to President George W. Bush
By Thomas H. Smith
Make no mistake about it, the U.S. is soon to attack Iraq. Why? The reason is simple: To make the big international bankers feel more comfortable about Israel's future.
During the past 60 years, 1 have been involved in some way with every war in which our country has been engaged. I was in the Army in WWII serving three years in the Air Force as a Radar Bombing System Technician. That was probably the least of my contributions to our country. On the other hand the Cuban Missile Crisis might have been my most important contribution. My point is that I don't think you can find anyone who loves our country (as it was founded) more than I do. However, I do not support an attack on Iraq given the information now available to us.
There is one “given** in history. Wars do not spring from their announced causes. 1 am sure you recall the published reason for the outbreak of World War I -the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand. That was not it, but simply an excuse.
Recall the supposed reason for the U.S. entry into World War I? The Germans had sunk the British ship Lusitania which was “bringing American refugees home from Europe** shortly after the outbreak of that war. Only it wasn't bringing refugees home, it was taking tourists to England! Befofp j( Ifffi New York, the German Ambassador discovered that the passenger ship was secretly being loaded with weapons and munitions for England. He discussed this with our government, but got a cold shoulder. He then took out ads in every major newspaper in the U.S., warning that the Lusitania, loaded with munitions, would be sunk. Meanwhile, the State Department and Churchill had agreed that, as the lhip approached the British l$lcs, Churchill would send out escort ships to bring it safely into port.
Next, our government warned all newspapers not to print the German ad. None printed it except for a single paper in Iowa. Of course the passengers going aboard the ship in New York were unaware of their danger. The ship's Captain had been ordered to sail at 3/4 speed to conserve coal. As the ship approached the c$pt oj England and the German
submarine area, British ships left port to provide an escort.
Then Churchill suddenly called back the escort ships, and the Germans easily sunk the slowly moving, unprotected ship. Our Secretary of State, William Jennings Bryan, who had argued strongly with President Wilson about allowing a passenger ship to load munitions at an American port, resigned shortly after the sinking.
Now, ask some questions about the WTC incident For instance, who was behind the destruction of the World Trade Center? Answer: 19 Muslims.
But who trained and motivated them? Why were 120 “suspected Israeli spies" deported, quietly, right after the 9-11 event? Some of these “spies’* actually lived in the same dormitories, or apartments, as the Muslims. One month before 9-11, a wealthy Jewish investor obtained leasing rights to the WTC Towers and promptly,

Dear Mr. President,
Yesterday you asked the CEOs of all companies to ensure that their financial accounting was under control. As the CEO of the largest firm in the world, you should be the one to take that first step. It was the federal government which started the practice of calling trust fund income and assets “surplus" and then applying it to the bottom line of the federal budget. It was your own father who signed a law in 1990 which forbade this practice. The law was the Senator Hollings Bill entitled: STOP LOOTING THE SOCIAL SECURITY TRUST FUND. I will attach a copy of a part of that law, but it is readily available in the Congressional Record.
THOMAS H. SMITH Fairhope, AL
From a Sen. Hollings speech; Date: Friday, January 30, 1998 10:32 AM; Subject: 1998CRS199A - STOP LOOTING SOCIAL SECURITY TRUST FUND; archive name: gov/us/fed/congress/re-cord/1998/jan/29/l 998CRS199A [Congressional Record: January 29, 1998 (Senate) Pages S199-S201. From the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access (wais.access.gpo.gov)).
(Senator) Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the thrust of President Clinton’s State of the Union address was “save Social Security first." The quickest way to save Social Security is to stop looting Social Security.
Over the years, we have looted the Social Security trust fund with wild abandon; we owe it to the tune of some $631 billion right this minute. It should be a $631 billion surplus. But actually, since Congress has expended it on foreign aid, defense, food stamps, and other programs in order to appear fiscally responsible, there is a deficit in Social Security. [THS: In 2002 the looting exceeds $1,000,000,000,000 -$1 trillion. Comparatively, Enron is a drop in the bucket.}
I see now from the Congressional Budget Office, and I take it from the President's budget to be submitted next Monday, that the CBO, along with the Congress and the President, is prepared, again, to go forward with this nonsense of a unified budget The unified budget is a fraud It allows Congress to spend money but get credit for not spending money. Only here do fiscally irresponsible people get a good government award.
Mr. President, Section 21 says take Social Security off the unified budget and record it as a separate trust fund. I also ask unanimous consent that section 13301 of the Budget Act be printed in the Record.

GOP’s logic on beyond Zebra
By Nelson Waller
nwaller@carol.net The article was perky. The writing was chic and bouncy. But the topic was deadly serious, and I felt obliged to comment in the Southern Heritage email forum. The subject was the GOP’s sudden yet passionate whim for going after NASCAR racing fans as a group with the next few years' worth of elections in mind.
The Dummacrat Party immediately had a “me too" fit but only hemmed and hawed about whether they really wanted to “go there." I think you’ll get the gist from reading my remarks, which follow the headline and Washington Times web address:
GOP candidates have voter trove at NASCAR track
http://www.washtimes.com/na-tional/20020630-3666816Ultra
This article is a throwaway but does amount to the politicians/prostiticians virtually admitting the horrible things we’ve been accusing them of for years, such as...
■ Neither party is capable of recognizing
any voter outside of some stupid, contrived, liberally-defined “electoral target group" anymore - with one exception:
■	Middle-class, normal, healthy while people; merely the backbone of the country for the past 400 years, and the largest “electoral target group" of them all - a mere 175 million people or so. These the two main parties simply ignore and stonewall, year after year after year, ever tinkering instead with the Hispanic vote, the black vote, the fag vote, the liberal Jewish vote and other slivers they could live without if they would simply do what is right and thereby gain the loyal support of the abovementioned pariah caste (and plenty of minorityites’ too, if truth were known).
■	This mentality leads to some of the most childish, demented, spineless and mindless tomfoolery we’ve seen the Parties indulge in, ever... like, for instance, reinventing middle-class, normal, healthy white people in terms of their pastimes. Only after this unmentionable pariah group has been thus repackaged, redefined, reinvented, and subdivided is it possible to court them as

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I got that reported out of the Budget Committee, and President George Walker Bush signed it into law on November 5, 1990: “Thou shaft not use the Social Security Trust Fund." But, Mr. President, Congress today totally ignores it. Here is the “Economic and Budget Outlook for Fiscal Year 1999 (Congressional Budget Office Report)." I ask unanimous consent that this Table 2 be printed in the Record.
[There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: (Page S200)|
Afterword-
in spite of the lew. Congress and the government continue to loot the SS Trust Fund and 149 other trust funds. The audit firm Price Waterhouse annually buys off on this deception, which started in 1985 under President Reagan and Treasury Secretary James Baker. See minutes of the Congressional meeting on Oct 30, 1985: “Hearing on Disinvestment of the Social Security Trust Fund to Finance Public Debt" (47 pages in the Congressional Record). As for the U.S corporations, I suppose they look at what the government is doing and simply say. " What is good for the government must be good for me too!" Is that where the accounting problems in our country started? On January 4, 2001,1 reported this to the Oversight Committee which is responsible for ensuring that all audit firms such as Arthur Anderson, etc., use the same standards. I never received a response. Will 1 get one this time? — THS
voters - partly, no doubt, because the party hacks know NASCAR fans still don't amount to enough of the electorate to make the GOP look “racist" for wooing them! Hey, there's a black NASCAR driver now too - Willy T. Ribbs by name!
■ The Dummacrats are still too pure to be seen running after any mostly white sector of the sheeple, meaning they may even be -thankfully - stupid enough to drive away the NASCAR vote as well as the “office-park dads" whom they also mention - that gang which is more prone to quiche-eating. Promise Keeping, McNcil-Lehrer watching, et al.l Strange world - no small thanks to the Republican Party, the org whose tent is big enough to take in anybody but the founding, identifying, taxpaying bulk of the electorate, and compassionate enough to make “love" to anybody but white people...
There is, of course, a way to effectively rip all the politicians' clothes off so the electorate can see what they’re made of and vote on the basis of merit alone: Destroy all political parties.	□
Owens exercises
“It’s probably going to be a long time before a statue of Martin Luther King Jr. or Rosa Parks joins the statues of Confederate heroes on the historic Capitol grounds.
“And Bus No. 2857 may never make it to the city seal.
“But the city now seems poised to give equal billing to its two historical heritages.
“And that’s something to build on.”
Thus gushed The Mobile Register's Gene Owens on June 30.
Mr. Owens:
Please explain to me how one can compare a simple march from Selma to Montgomery, which lasted only a couple of days, with the Birth of a Nation and the ultimate struggle for the freedom of the CSA and the return to constitutional rights. In addition, the birthplace of the civil rights movement was not Montgomery, but was in fact Washington, D.C. Please stop using your media bias to perpetuate incorrect facts and your own personal propaganda, as you have done so many times in the past.
It is common knowledge to those who research and study the true history of the South that the Rosa Parks incident was staged from the beginning by the NAACP and Washington, D.C. politicians, all the way down to the man who refused to give up his seat. Does anyone ever attempt to interview this man after the incident? Of course not. His name has slipped into obscurity, lest the truth be known.
Those who are intent on having all vestiges of the Confederacy removed from history have already tried to impose their lies upon our beloved capitol grounds. They continue to try, with much opposition, to remake the Cradle of the Confederacy into a civil rights shrine. Since aerial photos appearing in Ebony Magazine show, without a doubt, that the Selma-Montgomery terminus was not the capitol grounds, this attack has been temporarily shelved; however, we know that it will in the very near future once again rear its ugly head. Since the march did not reach the capitol grounds, the Alabama Historical Commission has attempted a plan which would slope the grounds down toward Dexter Avenue in a perverted attempt to bring the grounds down to where MLK spoke in the back of a flatbed truck parked on Dexter Avenue - all of this for the sole purpose of being able to rewrite history.
We will continue to fight the change of Montgomery’s city seal for the same reasons.0 To rewrite the history of one culture in order to appease another culture will never provide satisfaction to either side. Your media bias toward this lie tends to make us work even harder in order to keep the likes of you from destroying the truth simply because you feel guilty that your ancestors may have once owned slaves. Get over it, learn the truth and stop poisoning the minds of those who are uneducated and therefore gullible to your bias.
We dare defend our rights!!
LINDA SEWELL Mobile
You need to go back to school (and not a government education camp) and learn the skill of critical thinking rather than some mindless repeating of platitudes. Civil rights did not begin in Montgomery, so why do we need to put a lie on our seal? Civil rights, so-called, began in the Imperial City of D.C., cooked up by a bunch of black-robed demi-gods advancing their leftist agenda. Marching in front of cameras backed by the 101st Airborne hardly equates with bringing forth a new nation to continue what our forefathers started in 1776. It was just a continuation of the socialist creep that began in 1861 at the national level. The only reason it advances is because of brute, naked force. Over and over we have stood up and been beaten down by the bayonets. Government must •

rest on the consent of the governed, not Federal/Imperial troops. And one more thing: To equate an adulterous, commie symp like MLK with the heroes of our Confederacy, the highest point in Southern history, is an unspeakable obscenity I These men put their lives between kith and kin to repel the invading hordes who brought fire and sword through Dixie in the War of Northern Aggression.
MLK and his ilk were, and are, not fit to lick their boots or dusty bare feet as they fought outnumbered and outgunned against the greatest military power this world has ever known. Shame on you, sinah!

SOME ALWAYS COME LATE “Why is slavery monument seen as symbol of honor, healing, but Confederate flag is a painful reminder of slavery?” (www starbanner.com/News/prayersheard 703.shtml) A/.W. COMMENTS:
That’s a good question. May I point out a certain propaganda ploy beloved by the govemment/media complex?
The whole time they were militating to get the flag off the South Carolina dome, the mantra had S.C. as the last state to fly the flag over its capitol. And when, at the exact same time S.C. put up the Senator Glenn F. McConnell Monument to Black Racism, price tag over SI million, the mantra was. South Carolina is the first state to erect an “afro-american heritage " monument on its capitol plaza. There will be more monuments to the Civil Wrongs Era, Martin Lucifer King et al, if we don’t put a stop to it, folks. Let’s educate and agitate till we’ve beaten back the entire liberal agenda. Don’t forget, only about 396 of the American people supported the Revolution till it was a done deal.

NO AND YES. This one particularly amused the l.Q. experts, who noticed how quickly those newspapers routinely condemning l.Q. tests as biased and meaningless were to endorse intelligence exams recommended by the June 20th votes of six Supreme Court Justices that ban the execution of murderers scoring poorly on such tests. The New York Times, for example, which consistently refuses to mention l.Q. in its coverage of student performance and other topics where that would appear to be highly relevant, editorialized, “[I)nflicting the death penalty on individuals with LQ. scores of less than 70 who have little understanding of their moral culpability violates civilized standards of justice.” Who says you can't have it both ways?
AFRICAN-AMERICAN real estate agents want the Leon County Commission to ban the future use of “plantation” in naming subdivisions or streets, explains the Tallahassee Democrat. “It hurts sales, they say, because some African-American home buyers flinch at the idea of owning a piece of property on land that was once worked with slave labor. Many find it ironic if not downright offensive and awkward to accept a plantation as an address.” Well, then, let’s ban “Self-Government Anns” (ahem, apartments, not machine guns): to avoid offending not only our household-hyphens but also those Commo-Amerikans climbing in these days thru the windows.

“The greater the power, the more dangerous the abuse.99
- Edmund Burke
By Nick Jongebloed
For years parents in many of our largest cities have urged their elected officials to establish some sort of voucher or parental choice so that their children could be able to move from a failing public school to another public or private school. A few years ago, I, too, urged the legislature of Alabama to pass some form of voucher bill that would permit poor inner city students to have the choice of attending another public school. I did this as a candidate for the Mobile County School Board. This stirred up outrage among the education bureaucrats.
Why inner city schools?
Because, as with most major cities, Mobile’s inner city schools have a pathetic record in educating their students. Incredibly, given that the vast majority of these failing schools are in the “inner cities” and are predominately black, one of the major opponents of vouchers is the NAACP. Just this past week, after the U.S. Supreme Court came to the rescue of these children with its decision in the Cleveland case, this organization, whose charter was for the “advancement of colored people,” went on the attack at its annual convention.
The Cleveland case was the seventh consecutive defeat in the courts across the country for these enemies of choice, whose tenacity is inversely proportional to the morality of their cause. What was the reaction of the so-called black leaders?
“A minority of mean-spirited politicians and demagogues” have redefined the meaning of civil rights, equality and
deploy are wasted? The bureaucrats posit the virtuousness of public schooling whether it produces illiterates or geniuses. 2.) The First Amendment and the Wall of Church-State Separation: Vouchers used at religious schools would weaken the Wall, possibly causing it to crumble and thus weakening our democratic structures. The Supreme Court majority rejected precisely this argument. The purpose of vouchers isn’t to put innocent schoolchildren in the way of proselytization by this team of evangelists or that one; it is to offer them better educational alternatives. Teachers and principals are supposed to be smart people. Some apparently fall a bit short — at least when discussing questions like the reform of their own profession and its practices.
The greatest disaster that has occurred in public education in the last 50 years is the lack of education of black children from low income areas in our inner cities. Government schools in these places have been a devastating failure. Public education played a key role in our early history by fostering the “mixing” of newcomers into society, thus preventing divisiveness - enabling citizens from different cultural and religious backgrounds to live and work together in harmony. In recent years that performance has declined.
Another argument put "forward lately against school choice is that some parents may select a charter school run by a for-profit organization, such as Edison Schools. Opponents cast into the same lot with Ken Lay, Bernie Embers and others connected with the Enron and WorldCom scandals those persons who want to trust private enterprise or even some religious
Incredibly, given that the vast majority of these falling schools are in the “Inner cities” and are predominately black, one of the major opponents of vouchers is the NAACP.
dignity, warns Julian Bond, chair of the schools with the responsibility of educating NAACP. The answer,'he says. Is to help our children. Never mad tha pmw—
lin recent years has been more concerned
the NAACP fight this ruling “with media, organizing, voter registration, litigation, mobilization and coalition building.”
Of course Bond is upset because his opponents believe civil rights mean the equality of all people before the law. Bond and his allies in the black leadership, including the infamous Jesse Jackson, have manipulated the American people and painted a false portrait of themselves for many years. They exploit persistent feelings of white guilt, to maintain an expansive racial spoils system.
Preferences such as so-called affirmative action are designed to deliver educational opportunities, government contracts and choice jobs to members of particular groups, irrespective of their personal backgrounds, characteristics or qualifications. Jesse Jackson chimes in with his ability to deliver millions of black votes for favored politicians, almost all Democrats. He wants to blind black citizens with rage and hatred, so that he can continue to enrich himself and his friends and wield power as the top black influential political figure in the country.
Government schools are failing those they were designed to help the most So what’s the establishment position? The schools may not be any good, but that’s beside the point. It s the civic obligation of poor children to attend them anyway: to throw away their minds andfutures, so as to underwrite the careers of those in the education bureaucracy.
The educrats are terrified. Competition between theirs and private schools would undermine that reflexive, unthinking support to which the publics believe themselves entitled. Competition must be suppressed, says the head of the National Teachers Union (NEA); there can’t even be pilot programs. Such programs might get the customers to comparing value, as in a supermarket or department store. Publicly, the bureaucrats put forth two reasons not to have vouchers: 1.) They drain resources from the public schools. But why shouldn’t they, if the resources that public schools
with tainted food products or rotten produce than this “rotten education” provided by the educrats running our public schools!
When I heard on the radio that the Supreme Court had voted 5-4 in favor of the Cleveland voucher plan, I knew that the court had removed one of the major arguments carried out by the educational bureaucrats to resist vouchers and parental choice. The court rejected arguments against vouchers based on the church-state separation. This could also be a great day for those students in Alabama who are now locked in failing public schools.
With this decision from the Supreme Court, and President Bush’s reform plan to provide transportation for students locked in Title 1 schools that are failing, we may soon see a few more black faces in the news when area top academic teams are named. And what event will aid in this success in our great state of Alabama? The election of our next governor. Bob Riley has advocated parental choice and a voucher plan for the citizens of this state. The incumbent governor is in the pocket of the AEA, the powerful and militant teachers union that has over the past 30 years gained tremendous political power in the Alabama legislature and has now total control over educational policy, including classroom size, teacher testing, background checks, and the establishment of teacher controlled committees to approve policies and to curb and challenge the power of school principals. This can be reversed in the upcoming general election for the next governor of the state of Alabama.
[Editor's note. Important as it is to rid ourselves of Don Siegelman and Lee Warner, the liberal media scored early on ns in the June primary by blacking out the news and views of Tim James: the only major gubernatorial candidate opposed to killing our state constitution. God help us, whether it’s Republican Riley or Libertarian Sophodeus at the helm; please let it not be “Singleterm.”]

Only extreme power could successfully hide such blatant hypocrisies
by David Duke
www.davidduke.com/radk>
We live in an upside down, crazy world. Now you might say: how do I know that the world is crazy, maybe the world is right side up and you are the crazy one. Well I might be, but let me offer my evidence of the world's craziness, and see if your own reason does not agree with mine.
When I say the world, I am speaking about the major establishment, the media, and the other instruments of power that shape our world. And when I say craziness,
I am speaking about the most amazing hypocrisies that one can imagine.
Let me give you a prime example, and it should offer you an excellent illustration of the power of the Jewish supremacists who dominate the world's media and governmental establishments. And this very recent example also reveals the absolute, incontrovertible hypocrisy of these oligarches of the New World Order.
I want to quote to you from a news article datelined July 8, 2002. It appeared in numerous Jewish newspapers around the world but in almost no mainstream American newspapers. I will quote from the article titled, “Bill would bar Israeli Arabs from state lands." The text I am using appeared in the Cleveland Jewish Times by Naomi Segal. I will quote some excerpts for you,
JERUSALEM, July 8 (JTA) - Israel’s Cabinet stirred up a hornet’s nest this week by backing ^ bill that could bar Israeli Arabs ffbm owning homes on state-owned land.
At Sunday’s weekly Cabinet meeting,
17 ministers voted in favor of the bill, while two opposed and one abstained.
Cabinet minister Dan Meridor, who was one of two ministers to vote against the bill, called the decision a “grave error” that was “flagrantly discriminatory."
The bill was proposed by National Religious Party legislator Haim Druckman to circumvent a March 2000 decision by the High Court of Justice that the state cannot allocate land in a way that discriminates against any Israeli citizens.
The court issued its ruling after the northern community of Katzir refused to permit an Israeli Arab couple to move there.
The court said the government broke the law when it allocated state-owned land to the Jewish Agency for Israel to build a community that barred Israeli Arabs from having homes there.
The bill states that the establishment of Jewish-only communities is contingent upon approval from the defense minister or ministers responsible for the law’s enforcement that such a move is required because of “security reasons" - or to ensure the character of a community that is built upon certain ideals that all its residents must share.
Unquote.
Now let’s clearly understand just what this new Israeli bill does. This bill is backed by 17 of the 19 members of the Israeli cabinet Without any equivocation, the bill demands that the Israeli government will prevent the 20 percent Israeli citizens who are Arab from buying and owning government land in Israel. The Israeli government, by the way, owns 85 percent of Israel’s land. The bill provides for the complete barring of Arab Israeli citizens from living in Jewish settlements! To quote the article, “ .. .to ensure the character of a community that is built upon certain ideals that all its residents must share."
This bill favored by almost all of the Israeli cabinet is nothing more than an enforced governmental segregation against Arabs. It is racial Apartheid, in fact, far more draconian than the Apartheid of South Africa, for at least the Blacks were given in theory the right to self-rule in their own homelands.
Now let’s remember that Israel is supported by almost the entire American media establishment and the government
of the United States sends billions of dollars of aid to Israel every year, even military equipment to enforce their apartheid state and their brutal military occupation of lands that are made up of 95 percent Palestinian people.
But, isn’t this the same Jewish-dominated media and government establishment that condemned and outlawed racial segregation in America? In fact, it is the very same American government establishment that forbids any governmental racial discrimination, and even forbids private citizens from any kind of racial discrimination in selling their own property.
In actual fact Israel is far more segregated than America ever was. Integration has occurred in many parts of America for years in both schools and neighborhoods from the very beginning of our country. In Israel, practically every school, every settlement and even every apartment house is rigidly segregated between Jews and non-Jews. And this racial segregation not only is unopposed, it is hardly even mentioned in the mass media.
As far as South Africa was concerned, America not only did not send it military support; America did everything it could to wreck and destroy the South African economy. And the Jewish-dominated press in America and around the world went on a non-stop campaign against the evils of South African Apartheid.
So, why has there been no media campaign against Israel? Where is the outrage in the press about the Israeli discrimination and suppression of Palestinians? Where is the demand to disinvest from Israel? Where is the mass movement, supported
by the press, to stop military aid to this Israeli Apartheid regime?
Even the foundations of Israel are based on race, and not religion. Even a state that bases its immigration on religion would be deemed discriminatory and against the new morality of multiculturalism. But Israeli immigration policy is based entirely on Jewish genetic heritage, and these Jews need not be Jewish by religion, but only Jewish by blood, Jewish by race, to immigrate. The press has so brainwashed the American people about Israel and the Jews that some listening to this broadcast might even object to my calling the Jews a race. Yet, they are not even aware that prominent Jewish leaders themselves often refer to the quote “Jewish race.” Even Palestinians bom in what now constitutes Israel and whose families lived there for thousands of years are not allowed to return. Of course, the Israeli government actively seeks Jews from all over the world to immigrate to Israel and then subsidizes their immigration, and part of that money comes from American tax dollars.
Imagine for a minute if America’s immigration was limited only to White Europeans. Imagine, if the government spent billions to seek out only Whites from around the world to come to America, while completely banning non-white immigration. Do I have to paint for you the venomous outrage on the part of the Jewish-dominated, liberal media?
Am I crazy to notice this hypocrisy? Am I the one who is crazy, or is it the media?
Take another example. There has been huge coverage in America recently of the arrest of a young Black criminal near Los Angeles. The Black criminal violently
PONT “RAC” MY COONS!
Cultural cleansing in the South
It's perfectly all right for 99% of the people to be offended\ but not those few who side with the media.
By Roger Young
Not far north of Dallas, Texas lies the community of Frisco. This sprawling suburb claims to be the fastest growing city in the state, which is a fact hard to argue when you consider that the town’s population has grown nearly 400% in just the last 10 years to nearly 49,000 residents. While growth of this magnitude will certainly change the appearance and feel of a small town, recently events have occurred that illustrate how old conflicting with new happens within a city’s culture as well.
In March 2002, the Frisco school board voted to change the name of Frisco High School's mascot from the Fighting Coons to the Fighting Raccoons. Board members decided to change the mascot name in the interest of racial sensitivity. Supposedly, some residents complained that “coon" is a racial slur against blacks. School superintendent Rick Reedy agreed and recommended that board members modify the name. “If one student is made to feel uncomfortable, that is one too many," he claimed, despite the fact that the town has lived harmoniously with the “Coon" moniker for 79 years. School Board President Dan Presley chimed in, “There are kids moving here and parents who are moving here that are hurt by it and they shouldn’t be hurt by it."
Finding blacks who are offended by the name, however, appeared to be quite a challenge. “The word ‘coon* doesn’t define who I am," said Otto Hannah, a 2001 graduate and football player who is black. “Changing the name would be taking away the tradition and legacy that people have worked so hard for." A large crowd showed up at the eventful school board meeting, some with T-shirts that read, “Don't RAC my Coons!" Absolutely no one in the audience spoke in support of the change. Despite this, the board, in a great example of representative
democracy, voted unanimously to rid the school and community of this scandalous name.
In the grand scheme of things, changing a high school’s mascot name is, I agree, a relatively minor occurrence; but not so insignificant as to be ignored and escape analysis. Following The War of Northern Aggression, corrupt scoundrels backed by the policy of Reconstruction robbed and pillaged the South of property and wealth. Concurrently, those who despised Southern culture worked to eliminate any sliver of uniqueness. This process has been much more incremental and continues to this day. Step by step. Southern culture is being robbed now, not of its property so much (except through onerous federal taxes) but of its heart and soul. Rather than being the victim of the plundering Union Army, the South now must withstand the volleys of political correctness being lobbed continuously by transplanted Yankees as well as by domestic scalawags indoctrinated through government schooling.
Ever notice how the Left loves democracy except, of course, when they lose? School superintendent Reedy claims the name should be changed “if [just] one student is made to feel uncomfortable." So, in this case, at least, a minority of one can overturn the will of a majority. Hardly a textbook illustration of “democracy," wouldn’t you agree? The Righteously Anointed (the leftist elites) seem to reserve the right to overthrow the will of the Great Unwashed (the people) when majority decisions do not conform to the party line of collective thought. This parallels Lincoln's view of the Confederacy. Even though a majority within each seceding state agreed they no longer wanted to be part of the existing Union, the moral imperialists, led by Lincoln, insisted they remain bound. Apparently, this conviction was worth sacrificing the lives of tens of thousands of fellow countrymen.
Southerners must constantly battle a “Yankee imperialism” buttressed by the concepts of false history, paganism, cultural Marxism, intellectual homogenization and
resisted arrest, and the policeman who was assaulted treated him very roughly. The videotape seems to indicate that one of the arresting officers might even have struck him after he was subdued. There was outrage in our Jewish-run newspapers across America and the world. This was all offered as evidence of the racist nature of America.
Of course, the truth is that the incident was not about this Black individual’s race, but about his criminality. Police tend to be very rough with those who violently resist arrest. White or Black.
Now contrast the media treatment of this incident with the official policy of the Israeli government. 'Ihe Israeli government and military have occupied a land of over two million people against their will for over 35 years. They have incarcerated hundreds of thousands with no probable cause, they have tortured tens of thousands, they have bulldozed thousands of homes, they have killed and maimed thousands of men, women and children in one of the most brutal military occupations the world has ever seen. What is Israel’s justification for this slaughter - that the Palestinians have resisted this illegal and brutal military occupation? The other day an independent cameraman journalist caught Israeli tank gunners firing at and killing children on their bicycles. Where is the outrage?
Only extreme power could successfully hide such blatant hypocrisies from the world. It is a nefarious power that threatens not only the freedom of the Palestinians but all the world, and not least the American people.
This has been David Duke with some of my latest thoughts.
uniformity of purpose. Their authentic culture has never been acceptable to the Leftist aristocracy because it will not accommodate their bigotry. When the nickname “Coon" was chosen way back in 1924, there is no evidence that it was meant as a racial slur. That attitude was imported by insular, intolerant transplants. Clyde Wilson, writing for The League of the South, states: “They [Leftist Northerners and their intellectual sympathizers] have no heritage of their own and do not know what a heritage is. They believe in their own self-interest and fashionable abstractions."
Michael Hill, president of The League, writes this in response to Northern attacks on Southern nativism: “All we’ve ever wanted from you and yours was to be left alone. But you people could not oblige us because God has fitted you by nature to be busy bodies. And on top of that, you're envious busybodies. Having no real cultural inheritance of your own, you have sought to destroy what wc have out of sheer spite. You are not the sort to make good neighbors.”
What can we expect in the future? When the lights finally go out in California (and economic law says they will), Texas can expect to see many migrants arrive from the Golden State. Don’t be surprised to be a witness to this scenario: the word “Fighting" will be dropped from the mascot name so as not to encourage an atmosphere of violence. After all, “one" student may feel threatened and offended. The “Fighting Raccoons" may just morph into the “Recycling Raccoons."
As in any situation where people are abused and individual thought and conscience is squelched, resistance arises to give the tyrannized hope. Tracey Stafford, a black, Frisco sophomore, claimed changing the name is “pointless.” She and others pledged to continue using the name. “We’re still going to say we’re Coons," she said. “We’re all Coons.”

August 2002 The First Freedom 7
Slavery only became a constitutional issue after the war had begun
By Randall G. Holcombe L
ldcawb^|iwctici>i.ftu.dtt Special interests have long used the democratic political process to produce legislation for their own private benefit, and the U.S. Constitution contains flaws that make this easier. One attempt to remedy these flaws was the Confederate Constitution.
The Confederate Constitutional Convention opened in February 1861. Robert Barnwell Rhett of South Carolina, called the “Father of Secession** for initiating his state's breakoff from the union, thought that the U.S. model was the best. The other SO delegates agreed. He nominated Howell Cobb, a Georgia attorney and former Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, to preside over the meeting, which was completed by March 11,1861. By the end of that year, 13 states had ratified the new Constitution.
In broad outline, the Confederate Constitution is an amended U.S. Constitution. Even on slavery, there is little difference. Whereas the U.S. Constitution ended the importation of slaves after 1808, the Confederate Constitution simply forbade it. Both constitutions allowed slave ownership, of course.
In fact, slavery only became a constitutional issue after the war had begun. In his 1861 inaugural address, Abraham Lincoln said, “Apprehension seems to exist among the people of the Southern States that by the accession of a Republican administration their property [is] to be endangered...
I have no purpose, directly or indirectly to interfere with the institution of slavery in the United States where it exists... 1 believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so.**
But the differences in the documents, small as they are, are extremely important. The people who wrote the Southern Constitution had lived under the federal one. They knew its strengths, which they tried to copy, and its weaknesses, which
they tried to eliminate.
One grave weakness in the U.S. Constitution is the “general welfare** clause, which the Confederate Constitution eliminated.
The U.S. Constitution gives Congress the power to “lay and col lect Taxes, Duties, Imposts, and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States.**
The Confederate Constitution gave Congress the power “to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises, for revenue necessary to pay the debts, provide for the common defense, and carry on the Government of the Confederate States...**
The Southern drafters thought the general welfare clause was an open door for any type of government intervention. They were, of course, right.
Immediately following that clause in the Confederate Constitution is a clause that has no parallel in the U.S. Constitution. It affirms strong support for free trade and opposition to protectionism: “but no bounties shall be granted from the Treasury; nor shall any duties or taxes on importation from foreign nations be laid to promote or foster any branch of industry.**
The use of tariffs to shelter domestic industries from foreign competition had been an important issue since tariffs were first adopted in 1816. Southern states had borne heavy costs since tariffs protected Northern manufacturing at the expense of Southern imports. The South exported agricultural commodities and imported almost all the goods it consumed, either from abroad or from Northern states. Tariffs drastically raised the cost of goods in the Southern states, while most of the tariff revenue was spent in the North.
The Confederate Constitution prevents Congress from appropriating money
—for any internal improvement intended
to facilitate commerce” except for improvement to facilitate waterway
navigation. But “in all such cases, such duties shall be laid on the navigation facilitated thereby, as may be necessary to pay for the costs and expenses thereof...”
“Internal improvements” were pork-barrel public works projects. Thus the Southern Founders sought to prohibit general revenues from being used for the benefit of special interests. Tax revenues were to be spent for programs that bene-fitted everyone, not a specific segment of the population.
In another attack on pork-barrel spending. the Confederate Constitution gave the President a line-item veto. “The President may approve any appropriation and disapprove any other appropriation in the same bill.” Anticipating the U.S. Constitutional amendment that would become necessary after Franklin Roosevelt's four terms, the President himself would serve only one, six-year term.
In many circumstances. Confederate appropriations required a two-thirds majority rather than a simple majority. Without the President's request, for example, a two-thirds majority of both Houses would have been necessary for Congress to spend any money. This one provision, if adopted in the U.S. Constitution, would eliminate much of the spending that goes on today.
The Confederate Founders also tried to make sure that there would be no open-ended commitments or entitlement programs in the Confederate States. “All bills appropriating money shall specify... the exact amount of each appropriation, and the purposes for which it is made,” said the document. “And Congress shall grant no extra compensation to any public contractor, officer, agent, or servant, after such contract shall have been made or such service rendered.” Such a provision would have eliminated the “cost-overrun,” a favorite boondoggle of today's government
contractors.
The Confederate Constitution also clim-inated omnibus spending bills by requiring
all legislation to “relate to but one subject,” which had to be “expressed in the title.” There would be no “Christmas-tree” appropriations bills or hidden expenditures.
These changes would have had a profound effect in keeping government small and unintrusive. Their inclusion demonstrates much wisdom on the part of Confederate statesmen in improving on the Founding Fathers. Unfortunately, the federal government was not willing to let them give their system a try.

Southern heritage move puts stopper to memory hole
As reported in The Birmingham News on July 17,2002, seven Cherokee students have brought a lawsuit against the Lawrence County, Alabama schools superintendent and their high school principal for banning the Confederate Flag, Principal Ricky Nichols having suspended 16 students last October for showing it Nichols and Superintendent Dexter Rutherford were named in the suit filed in Huntsville District Court.

LAWSUIT FILED REGARDING CONFEDERATE-CHEROKEE STUDENTS RIGHT TO EXPRESS HERITAGE
Parents on behalf of seven students have filed a lawsuit against Lawrence County High School officials because of ongoing constitutional and civil rights violations in Lawrence County Schools. Numerous students at Lawrence County High have suffered discrimination as the result of a policy which bans the wearing of Confederate symbols.
In October of 2001, the principal at Lawrence County High School began suspending students that displayed Confederate symbols on their clothing. Many students at Lawrence County High school consider the ban insulting to their heritage. Cherokees played an extensive role as Confederate-Southern Americans during the civil war, and students at Lawrence County High School, many of whom are of Confederate-Cherokee ancestry, hold Confederate symbols in veneration. One student, wearing a Dixie Outfitter shirt, was told by a school
employee that anyone wearing that type of shirt was an ignorant idiot. Cherokee and/or Confederate-Southern Americans find the school's bias against Confederate heritage deeply offending.
Approximately 80 students expressed their disapproval of the ban by signing a petition requesting that the ban be rescinded. The school made no reply to the petition, nor any attempt to assuage the discriminatory environment.
The students, parents, their attorneys and members of the Alabama Division, Sons of Confederate Veterans, went before the school board twice explaining that the students felt their constitutional and civil rights were being violated. Furthermore, parents and the Sons of Confederate veterans offered a proposal meant to reconcile student rights and the schools policy against Confederate symbols. The school board was offered educational seminars regarding the meaning(s) of Confederate symbols. To date, the school board is not responding to this proposal by parents and Sons of Confederate Veterans, or to requests to end the ban on Confederate symbols.
SLRC Chief Trial Counsel Kirk D. Lyons and Native American Initiative Attorney Charles E. Yow filed the complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama sitting in Huntsville. Larry Becraft of Huntsville is serving as local counsel. The suit names Lawrence County High School Principal Ricky Nichols and Superintendent Dexter Rutherford in their official capacities.

Officers heard Israelis report the ship as American on radio frequencies
This was the winning essay in a national contest sponsored by the USS Liberty Veterans Association.
Give me liberty and give me the truth
By Carrie Ritter
Age 18, Corpus Christi, TX Tuloso-Midway High School. Grade 12
Triumph and tragedy |_ are often birthed from the same parent. I Such an occurrence took place in 1967 when the fate of a United States Naval vessel was sealed by events beyond the sailors* control. Tragedy came first, but triumph prevailed. The triumphs and tragedies surrounding the events concerning the ship and crew remain a source of keen historical interest.
The year 1967 was fraught with innumerable changes for the United States. The space program halted after a fatal accident on Apollo I Race riots broke out in Detroit, and baseball great Mickey Mantle was at the top of his game. Mod makeup and funky clothing reigned.
The country was focused on the Vietnam Conflict, when the Six Days War began in the Middle East Since early spring, Egypt had threatened Israel. In May, Nassar ordered the United Nations peacekeepers to leave Egypt and the Gaza Strip. Israeli tanks reported for duty on the Sinai Peninsula stirring Egypt to call up 100,000 army reserves and close the Gulf of Aqaba. On May 23, 1967, the Israelis termed the blockage “an act of aggression against Israel.** In less than two weeks, Israel | had moved across its borders in a preemptive strike.
On June 2nd, the ill-fated, intelligence gathering USS Liberty departed from Rota, Spain, en route to the eastern Mediterranean. The atrip was told to hone in on communications in the area and report to the National Security Agency (NSA). However, orders for the ship*s locations were given out by the Navy.
NSA officials expected the Liberty to anchor off the coast of Crete, but Naval authorities directed the ship to “troll** off the Egypdan/Israeli coast in international
mission. Suddenly, orange flashes streaked across the ship, and men were thrown into the air from the force of the blasts. Mirage jets attacked the ship, disabling its only defense, the four 50-caliber machine guns. Radio antennas were knocked out as well. Mystere jets added to the strafing by pummel ing the ship with endless napalm bombs, and flames rose up from all sides of the ship. Radiomen desperately sought a clear radio frequency, and even after a napalm bomb exploded in their compartment, they continued to send distress calls.
The USS Saratoga 1 received Liberty^ calls for| help. Captain Joseph Tully did not wait for instructions.
He turned his ship into the wind and launched aircraft. Before they could reach the distressed ship, Washington furiously recalled them. The Saratoga crew was frustrated as they knew they were j the Liberty's only chance for survival. Why the jets were told to return remains a mystery, although some speculate that President Johnson told the officers he would “...not embarrass America's allies.** Not to give Russia the impression we were in war, Johnson informed Premier Kosygin on the hot line that American jets had been sent out for the sole purpose of I investigating the incident.
The attack from the air endured for an additional 30 minutes. Torpedo boats soon arrived to finish the job. Five torpedoes were fired; only one succeeded, severely I damaging the ship. It directly hit the cryptological compartment, killing 25 and momentarily trapping 50 more men. The | 40-foot hole threatened to sink the ship. Captain McGonagle considered abandoning ship. However, rubber rafts were shot out of the water by Israeli torpedo boats as | the Liberty crew lowered them overboard. Eventually, Israeli helicopters arrived bringing an American attache. He dropped a note among the dead asking if there were casualties. Even the torpedo boats returned to signal, “Do you need help?** The Americans made a reply containing a few expletives. This message amounted |
to “No thank you!**
The attack on the Liberty was unprovoked and seemingly unexplainable. On the other hand, the crew members and many experts believe that Israel had indeed planned the attack and its subsequent coverup. First, the American flag, international maritime symbol for 200 years, was clearly visible with twelve knots of wind holding it unfurled. Additionally, ten foot high letters “AGTR-5** in English, not Arabic script, marked the ship as American. The Israelis admit looking at Jane's Fighting Ships to identify the craft. Furthermore, they had recorded the Liberty as the only non-Israeli ship in that sector. Therefore, the fact that it was non-Israeli should have told the attackers that it was American. Finally, during the attack, a Liberty signalman repeatedly identified the ship.
In the ensuing years theories have developed as to the motives of the Israelis, if indeed this was a deliberate attack. The most plausible of these explanations lies with their desire to take the Golan Heights. Previously, the Israelis had expressed their intent to take this territory. The U.S. government insisted Israel remain on the defensive. Secretary of State Rusk stated, “...military action against Syrian positions on Syrian soil... casts doubt on Israeli intentions and creates gravest problems.** So when our “spy ship” came into the war zone threatening to inform on their movements, Israel became outraged. They sought out the Liberty to completely destroy it and any eyewitnesses to their aggressive actions.
No matter what the motive, many Liberty survivors and other Americans hold that this was an intentional attack. However, Israel refuses to acknowledge this. They continually reply that this was just a “tragic mistake** that often occurs in the midst of wars.
Both the Israeli and American Navies immediately initiated Courts of inquiry to discover the true nature of the incident. Israel gave a formal apology and paid
Now is the time for a wake-up call
That Israeli attack on the USS Liberty was unprovoked and seemingly unexplainable.
waters.
On June 8, 1967, Israeli aircraft and torpedo boats heavily strafed and attacked the Liberty. The lambasting killed 34 and injured at least 171 others from a crew of 289. What occurred on that fateful day still remains a conflict between Israel and the United States. Many Americans maintain the attack was deliberate, while the Israelis claim it was an accident of mistaken identity.
Events placing the ship in danger actually began on June 7. The ship was noted on Israeli radar, and reconnaissance missions were organized to discover its identity. The day was clear, while a large American flag flew proudly over the Liberty. Israel recognized the ship as an allied U. S. intelligence ship. Officers heard Israelis reporting the ship as American on their radio frequencies. Israeli pilots even waved to Liberty crewmen. At the same time, NSA was making every effort to get the ship moved from its dangerous location. Removal messages were passed to the Navy who delivered them through a confusing communications system. The Liberty failed again and again to receive the orders. Messages were even mistakenly sent to the Philippines. A congressional committee later called this “one of the most incredible failures of communications in the history of the Department of Defense.**
The reconnaissance continued early on June 8th. Thd'crew of the Liberty relaxed. However, around 2.-00 PM, the Americans* false sense of security crumbled. Radar operators detected three jet aircraft and three torpedo boats approaching from the east The Americans were not alarmed, assuming this was another reconnaissance

“Attack one American and you attack all Americans” was once proclaimed by President Clinton. More recently, an Assistant Secretary for State proclaimed that the U. S. government always protects its citizens. These are damned lies, and meaningless words, not true in 1967 when Israel deliberately attacked the USS Liberty and, unfortunately, not true today.
On that June day in 1967, the weather was beautiful... clear and sunny, visibility unlimited. The USS Liberty, an elaborate, state-of-the art intelligence gathering platform in international waters off the Gaza strip, was flying the Stars and Stripes. Israeli reconnaissance planes flew overhead for hours. Pilots and ship's crew waved to each other. Then, inexplicably, unmarked Israeli aircraft began attacking the ship.
The defenseless Liberty radioed for help. Two aircraft carriers in the Med responded by launching fighter aircraft. Unbelievably, they were recalled by the White House. Rear Admiral Geis, then commanding the carriers in the Sixth Fleet, called Washington personally to confirm the order. Secretary of Defense McNamara came on the line, then President Johnson. Johnson indicated to Geis that the aircraft were to be returned, that he would not have his allies embarrassed, and that he didn't care who was killed or what was done
to the ship. Geis, like any good sailor, recalled the aircraft.
With no help forthcoming, the Liberty fell an easy victim to Israel's motor torpedo boat attack. Five torpedoes were lobbed at the Liberty; one hit amidships and instantly killed 25 sailors. A total of 34 died in the attack; 172 were injured.
The torpedo boats came within 50 feet of the ship, couldn’t see the American flag on the mast, couldn’t see the words “USS LIBERTY” on the stem, couldn’t see “GTR-5” in 10-foot letters on the bow. The boats shot at American sailors on the deck of the Liberty as the sailors tried to help one another. As life rafts were put in the water by Liberty sailors in preparation for abandoning the ship, the boats shot them up. One boat pulled one out of the water and took it on board. Didn't see the words “USS LIBERTY” stenciled on it The boats left the scene apparently when they received erroneous word that the carriers had sent fighters to help the Liberty.
President Johnson went on television and announced to the American people that ten sailors were killed in the “six minute accidental” attack. Sailors were ordered not to discuss the incident with anyone under threat of court-martial. We waited for the investigation, for the explanations and answers. Why did Israel attack the ship? Why did the U. S. Government turn its back on the crew members? The answers never came.
There has never been a congressional investigation; only a Wovy-controlled, whitewashed investigation of the crew's actions during the attack; but Israel's participation was not covered. Even in this, evidence was changed; officers and crew who knew the answers were not asked the
compensation to the families of men killed and wounded — a total of $7 million. Israel vehemently refused to cover the $8 million fee for the battered ship.
Their government would not accept the idea that it was the sole contributor to the attack. They felt the United States had made some mistakes that brought about dire consequences. The official U.S. Inquiry agreed that the incident was a horrible mishap and accepted the apology. Liberty crewmen, however, felt that the facts were covered up.
The major tragedies of damage to the ship and the death of the men are obvious. But there were other tragedies as well. The denial and cover-up by both the United States and Israel was an embarrassment to the sailors. Captain McGonagle, who courageously kept the ship afloat, was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor, quietly and privately at the Naval Shipyard rather than at the White House. Until Israel steps forward and acknowledges their intent in the attack, there will be no closure for the crew or the families of the deceased.
And yet, out of this tragedy arose long-reaching triumphs.
First, the men were able to keep the ship from sinking. No other ship of its type has taken such a torpedo hit and remained mobile. Secondly, the number of men who did survive was miraculous. Continuing to support each other emotionally, the crew has organized survivors meetings. Lastly, this incident and the one involving the Pueblo later in 1967 sparked action for Naval changes. Intelligence ships are no longer built without heavy artillery, nor are they sent out unescorted. Also, the military communication system has undergone augmentation and improvement
Throughout history, man has learned about himself through tragedy. The lessons learned during this event are no different Truly, the bravery of the men has not waned over the years. Thus, the triumph of this historic episode lies within the strength and courage of the human spirit which ultimately prevailed.
President Johnson went on television and announced to the American people that ten sailors were lulled in the “six minute accidental” attack. Sailors were ordered not to discuss the incident with anyone under threat of court-martial. We waited for the investigation, for the explanations and answers. Why did Israel attack the ship? Why did the US. Government turn its back on the crew members? The answers never came.
right questions, and were told to shut up when they offered information.
The attack has been a matter of controversy since 1967. Survivors and many key government officials including Secretary of State Dean Rusk and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Admiral Moorer say the attack was no accident. Two Israeli officers have come forward to admit that the attack was no accident. Yet the Israeli government and its supporters insist it was a “tragic case of misidentification,” and charge that survivors and their eyewitness supporters are lying.

What is even worse, I am convinced that the same thing could happen today!* Yes, I do believe that Israel could deliberately attack another U.S. ship today and get away with it; again, just exactly like they did in 1967! Israel has bragged about its control of the American Congress. And in May, 2002, Congress passed a resolution supporting Israel no matter what. 356 members of Congress signed on, only 21 opposed.** It has been said that Israel could get any legislation passed through Congress with a veto-proof margin. 1 do believe it

— Mark Twain July I, 2002 - Hey! Navy Times is conducting a poll this week, which asks the question: Should Congress reopen the investigation into the 1967 Israeli attack on the USS Liberty?

Israel says... they thought the ship was the Egyptian ship El Quseir, which is a horse carrier one-fourth the size of the Liberty. OK. Here, put yourself in the pilot seat of the Israeli fighters or the Israeli motor torpedo boats... and let's take a look at the ship they saw. See the picture of it here? Look at the big satellite dish antenna on the fantaiL the 10-foot high letters on the bow: “GTR-5.” Look at all the antennas. Is this an Egyptian ship?
The attack took place on June 8, 1967, on the U.S. intelligence ship USS Liberty (AGTR-5) in international waters off the Sinai Peninsula. For over 35 years the crew has been seeking the truth as to why they were attacked and left to die.

In 1967, when the Jewish controlled mediae racy began accelerating these culture wars, few dissenting opinions got published. Then the Washington based Spotlight came out with the Liberty story and other fare which the Jewish Defense League didn’t care for, and so got shut down by lawsuits a year ago. Six weeks later the Spotlight staff came right back with their new weekly, American Free Press, one of whose stories appears below.
And to sum up our case, here are a few excerpts from that officer who was on the bridge as the USS Liberty came under attack by the outlaw state of Israel\
A Survivor Speaks
By Jim Ernies
I find it very strange that some can argue endlessly that the attack on the USS Liberty was a tragic accident and not the deliberate attack on a known American ship that survivors know it to have been. A point that baffles me (and my shipmates) about that view is that the Israelis did not stop firing when they drew close enough to positively identify us as American.
I was lying in a stretcher in a starboard passageway just inboard of the wardroom and almost directly over the torpedo that exploded. I remember clearly the warning that torpedo boats were approaching followed by the explosion, the ship lifting away from the blast, then settling back to starboard and the very real fear that it would continue to settle until it rolled over and sank. Moments later the torpedo boats approached within fifty feet of the ship. One boat stopped alongside and trained a heavy machine gun on a man who was standing alone on a hatch on the main deck, but did not fire even though the man gave the boatmen the finger. Then a boat moved to within fifty feet of the fantail where the ship displayed her name in large letters in English painted on the hull and her GTR-5 numbers in even larger letters. The boatmen clearly examined those markings and can hardly have failed to see other very distinctive American markings and the American flag that flew from the mast. Yet, even though the Israeli government claims it
was at that point that they offered help, never firing at us again after the torpedo explosion, this is not so. Almost every man on that ship recalls - as I personally recall very clearly from my position outside the wardroom — that the torpedo boats then circled the ship for a long time firing at close range at anything that moved. Men trying to aid their wounded shipmates on deck were fired upon. Men fighting fires were fired upon and recall seeing their fire hoses punctured by machine gun fire. This went on for several minutes. At one point the boatmen concentrated their fire near the waterline amidships, presumably hoping to blow up the boilers to hasten our demise. Finally they pulled a distance back from the ship. We figured they were waiting for us to sink. And then at 3:15, forty minutes after the torpedo explosion and in response to orders from the bridge to prepare to abandon ship, men launched the only three life rafts that seemed still usable. The boats quickly drew closer, machine gunned the life rafts and then took one aboard after the machine gun fire severed a line that had tethered it to the ship. At this point, apparently in response to messages in the air from the Sixth Fleet promising (falsely) that aircraft were en route to our aid, the boats left the area. It was another 75 minutes later, about 4:30, that they finally returned to signal, “Do you need help?”
Our Congress, much to our dismay, has from the beginning accepted “at face value” the Israeli claim tbatthgy never fired again after the torpedo»explosion. Survivors have never been allowed to testify to the contrary, either to Congress or to the Court of Inquiry.
Yet a few Americans seem to accept the preposterous claim that the attack was a mistake and that firing stopped with the torpedo explosion. One can understand

Critics of Israel’s war machine torpedoed by AIPAC
The Israeli lobby is now targeting an outspoken black liberal congresswoman for extermination in Georgia.
By Michael Collins Piper
From American Free Press, 1433 Pennsylvania Av SE, Washington. DC 20003. Subscriptions $39 per year.
Emboldened by its recent victory in denying renomination to Rep. Earl Hilliard (D-Ala.), a black congressman who has been a critic of Israel, the well-funded Israeli lobby is now moving to destroy Rep. Cynthia McKinney (D-Ga.), another critic of U.S. policy toward Israel and the Arab world.
The Israeli lobby is gearing up to fund the campaign of McKinney's primary opponent - another black woman - Denise Majette who, according to the Jewish newspaper. Forward, “proudly touts a strong pro-Israel position.”
Not only has Mrs. McKinney been a longtime critic of Israel, but most recently Mrs. McKinney called for a full-dress congressional inquiry into Israel's unprovoked and premeditated June 8, 1967, murder of 34 American sailors during an attack by Israel’s naval and air forces on the USS Liberty as it sailed in the Mediterranean Sea.
Mrs. McKinney is not the only sitting member of Congress to dare call for such an inquiry. Rep. Jim Traficant (D-Ohio) is said to have been considering proposing a similar probe.
For that - and other statements considered inimical to Israel - Traficant was indicted by the Justice Department on corruption charges and was recently convicted. The black congresswoman also upset the Israeli lobby and the Bush administration by raising questions] as to whether the U.S. I administration - or other elements - may have had advance knowledge of the 9*41 terrorist attacks.
The Israeli lobby most recently exercised its clout in arranging the primary defeat of five-term Alabama Rep. Earl Hilliard, who - previously - had been hailed as the first black elected to Congress from Alabama.
After Hilliard began questioning U.S. policy toward Israel, however, the media turned on Hilliard and he was targeted for defeat.
American Free Press, in its July 8 issue, was one of the few national publications to describe the Israeli campaign against the embattled Hilliard, although his plight was well known in the Arab-American community which rushed to raise funds on his behalf when they learned that he was being targeted by Israel. [Our July issue of The First Freedom also had that story. -Ed.]
In defeat, Hilliard makes no apologies for his pro-American views and says that he expects the black community is not about to “sit still and let it happen” to Mrs. McKinney and other blacks in Congress
Alabama congressman down, Georgia congresswoman to go; this month's Israeli foreign aid goes to the Peach State. “Our favorite ally** can afford it; your “representative** sees to that.
who have been critical of Israel.
Hilliard's successful opponent. Artur Davis, was heavily funded by American Jewish contributors from across the country, and even showed up to play “Step ’n fetch it” before the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), the registered lobby for Israel in Washington.
For her part. Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-Tex.), chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, is afraid to criticize the Israeli lobby. She even went so far as to suggest that AIPAC had no real role in defeating Hilliard. In an interview she claimed disingenuously that “I don’t know what the group is,” referring to AIPAC, and then added - perhaps to sound less ignorant - “but they're basically Jewish people.”
As a reaction to Mrs. Johnson's ridiculous comments, some blacks are now calling Mrs. Johnson “Prissy” (referring to the silly slave girl in Margaret Mitchell’s Gone With the Wind).
Assisting the media and the Israeli lobby in the campaign against Mrs. McKinney is an outfit known as the Southeastern Legal Foundation (SLF). It has filed several complaints with the House Ethics Committee against Mrs. McKinney, essentially proving itself as what critics have called a “stalking horse” for Israeli interests.	□

■	A nation without a border is not a nation* said President Reagan. Should America continue as an independent, sovereign nation? Every poll answers with a resounding yes/ Americans want their border protected; and, if necessary, they want the military to help. President Eisenhower stopped illegal immigration by enforcing our laws. President Bush could do the same thing.
■	Why ean’t we stop the invasion? We are the most powerful nation on earth, yet we have been unable to stop millions of illegal aliens from crossing our borders. Why? Do we have enough Border Patrol Agents? If not, how many do we need? Don't we have the technology to detect people coming into the United States across barren land? If we do, why don't we use it? Should we build a fence like the Israelis are doing? How can they do it so fast?

Now we see how Sleaze Dees gels his "evidence. ” He gets it the old fashioned way. He buys it!
Phony “Hate Crime” Witness Confesses that Morris Dees Bought Perjury
(From: Southern Events, Vol. 7, Number I)
The San Diego Times-Union was the only newspaper to cover the story of Greg Withrow this past August, who admitted that his allegation of being nailed to a cross, like a crucifixion, on August 8,1987 was his own doing. He had four friends nail him to a cross and slightly cut his throat.
Withrow had testified against Tom Metzger in the highly publicized Portland case and falsely swore that Metzger told
barrier system stops them, placed there by a shamed government.
■	It is time to “light up the border” again, and show the American people that our nation is being invaded. This time, instead of headlights we use the internet. Just as we do with americanpatrol.com (the most popular immigration reform website), we will show illegals flooding into the United States firsthand, and, if possible, live. We will show what the Border Patrol is doing to stop this invasion, and why they fail. We will show what America could do to slop the invasion.
■	Working with ranchers. As has American Patrol for years, ABP will work with ranchers such as Roger Barnett of Douglas, Arizona (featured in Time Magazine) to focus on how, when and where illegal aliens are crossing our border. We will use video cameras and infrared technology to show, on a regular basis, how illegal aliens are violating our sovereignty. (What would Americans think of a webcam mounted on popular invasion routes? How many would log on to try to catch aliens invading their nation? Plenty.)
■	Border patrol tactics. Under the

Withrow now says that Morris Dees, founder of the SPLC, paid him SI500 to falsely testify against Metzger. He added that the only other witness against Metzger, David Mazella, also was paid by Dees to lie.
As a result Metzger lost the suit, costing him his home and business. Withrow said that Mazella continued to receive thousands of dollars from Dees to keep his mouth shut during the five years Metzger spent appealing the case to the Supreme Court. Then Dees cut off Mazella’s slush fund.
Withrow has now filed a $32 million
The plastic carrot
By Audrey Johnson
It is a law of physics. Two objects cannot occupy the same space at the same time. The usual illustration is the violent clash of vehicles on the highways, but the law applies to people as well. Two groups of people are fighting to occupy the same land in the Middle East Can the violent clashes be stopped?
George Mitchell, considered by many to be an honest broker, is talking about what both sides must do, but the attitude of the Bush Administration is openly pro-Israel. Bush condemns the violence by Palestinians, but makes no mention of violence by the Israeli army, and his pronouncements are so far off the mark that they are being ignored by both sides. Not only that, he has found a scapegoat for his bankrupt policies. That scapegoat is Yasser Arafat. Arafat is no better or no worse than either Bush or Sharon. He is being condemned because he has failed to accept the status quo and is opposing the continued Israeli encroachment on land and water needed by both Israelis and Palestinians. The U.S. government and its press are now trying to make the public believe that the cause of all the violence is Arafat, and if we could just get rid of him the situation would improve. Why, the Arabs could even have a Palestinian state! The Israeli Army is providing the stick, and George Bush has come up with the carrot!
But the Arabs know this is a plastic carrot Even if the Israelis accepted the idea the establishment of a Palestinian state would not necessarily mean more land, water, or better living conditions. Probably most of the people in the Bush Administration know this too, but they have to go along with a president who has a very limited grasp of the situation. Certainly Colin Powell understands the problem, but he lost the debate within the cabinet. Powell must be a good team player in order to keep
direction of Bill King, Ron Sanders, and other former Border Patrol officials, we will explain to the American people, on a blow-by-blow basis, how the battle for our borders is going. We will tell them why illegal aliens are dying in the desert and what we can do to stop it. We will tell them why illegal aliens continue to cross the border, even after they have been arrested up to fifteen times. We will tell the American people how terrorists can cross our borders undetected and undeterred. And, if they want to get personally involved, we will show Americans how to do it.
■	ABP will support the Border Patrol. Our network of concerned citizens along the border will represent an important source of reports, processed through ABP for confirmation. We will be in constant contact with agents working the line and let them know how much America is behind them.
■	Nothing more important. For many reasons, some of which cannot be made public now, I can think of no task more pressing than immediately securing our borders, as we work to launch American Border Patrol on September 1 st. With your help, we can do it.
suit against Dees and the Jewish Anti-Defamation League. At the time he alleged that Metzger had ordered unknown persons to carry out the “brutal attack.” Withrow was financed by the ADL on a national speaking tour telling his phony story.
Withrow was featured in many newspaper accounts and in People Magazine. On “Oprah" women wept as he related his tale. Actor Woody Harrelson paid Withrow for the movie rights to his story. Harrelson planned to play Withrow in the film.
Withrow testified before a California Senate Judiciary Committee in 1993 to help pass that state's hate crime laws. Q
his job, so he is now spouting the approved policy line.
It is discouraging to note that Tom Friedman and so many other journalists and commentators employed by a supposedly independent press are doing the same thing. They are parroting the attitude of George II, who sees things only in black and white. Bush probably looks at the puppet government that the CIA installed in Afghanistan and expects that a similar government could be put in place in the Middle East. Could it happen that way?
There are some big differences in the two situations. In Afghanistan there is no large scale dispute regarding individual land ownership. They kept the warlords, and the West has backed away from putting troops into their territories. Refugees are entering the country and going back to what is left of the homes they once had.
In the Middle East there are two very different groups of people fighting for the same land who live close to one another and have vastly different levels of income. In Afghanistan just about everyone is poor! Further, the peoples are very different. The Arabs in Palestine have had more contact with the West, more access to news and information, and thus have a more sophisticated understanding of the politics of their situation than do the Arabs in Afghanistan. Also, they are more proximate to Europe and elections would almost certainly be monitored by the UN and possibly other agencies. So what will happen?
The Bush Administration is not trusted by the Arabs. It is therefore highly unlikely the United States will be able to improve the situation, and the violence may get much worse and spread to other countries in the region. There is one encouraging note, and that is that the war in the Middle East is acting as a brake on plans that George II has for invading Iraq.

FACELESS IN FLORIDA After hearing the state of Florida change its opinion, thus letting a Muslim woman have her face-covered “picture” on a drivers license, all pcecee persons participating in that preposterous party received our July 2002 SCALAWAG OF THE MONTH award printed on a head-sized bag without eye holes, as scalawags are blind to their interests, and see the imagined Erehwon thereby more clearly.

I'm not a person who is sympathetic with KICK hoods; but, in the event your above message is correct and the State of Florida acquiesced to allowing a “Muslim woman have her face-covered 'picture' on a drivers license,” then I suggest that I might change my mind about the KKK (as well as the ACLU). If she was allowed that stupidity, then I believe the ACLU might join a case in support of clansmen to have their hooded pictures on drivers licenses in this fair Stale of Florida - or is it “State of Confusion**? The klan could thus be doing the people of Florida a favor by waking up the government to what 1 consider its own stupidity. Incensed? You bet I am. I thought the Governor's brother was asking the nation to assist in his war on terrorism, not assist possible terrorist sympathizers to get away with things “normal” citizens arc not allowed to do; i.e., hiding their faces on drivers licenses so that a Palestinian female suicide bomber could “borrow” such a drivers license. The ruling adds a higher probability to my being killed or maimed by a terrorist. I’ve been extremely lucky to date. Hate to see my luck (and, worse still, that of my family and neighbors) run out by such a rotten State decision.

Do what the Northeast - a nation hopelessly lacking in self-sufficiency or sustainability — fears far more: something like the “fuel protests” by those truckers in Europe, outraged over the price of fuel a couple years ago. Remember how they shut down France and Britain within a week just by refusing to deliver fuel and blockading fuel depots? Well, most all truckers who make the daily truck runs the Northeast is totally dependent on for food, fuel and toilet paper are Southerners - and most of them now make about nothing, particularly owner-operators. A truckers’ vacation which refuses to delivery anyplace north of Virginia would shut down NYC within a week, and have most all of the Northeast's big cities in chaos by then.

Wouldn't it be nice if the White middle class would all decide to “stay home” on a given day. Do not go to work, do not go
I am sure the impact would be felt by communities and perhaps it would awaken the White middle class to the power that we have. And perhaps future flexing of our muscles on other “projects” would be realized. Hopefully, it will be fun and not only send a message to the “controlling*’ powers but will motivate the White middle class to go on to bigger and better things as a united group. (Love your writing.) My heart and soul are in the South.

FLAG GETS AROUND Here in Britain, I locate and care for Confederate graves. Some of these soldiers fought in Alabama regiments. Britain had. and still has, great connections with the South. Over 140,000 of the 1861 Southern states' population were bom here. The struggle of the Southern people in the War of '61 is well known the whole civilized world over. A quarter of a million people died in an attempt to gain independence for the land that was theirs, and today the Southern people seem to be under attack again. If you ever come to Britain, you may be surprised to see Confederate Flags flying beside grave sites from Liverpool on the west coast to Scarborough on the east, and from the highlands of Scotland to Cornwall, a county deep in the southwest. Southern heritage has many supporters worldwide and few enemies . . : outside America.	JOHN	COLLIER

AP: "... where the first slaves arrived in Georgia. Savannah unveiled a bronze and granite monument to Mack Americans... after a decade of delays\and debate. The monument, depicting a black family embracing with broken chains at its feel...
Many Blacks complain about Confederate culture on the basis that it reminds them of the enslavement of their ancestors. Of what is the inscription on this new monument to Blacks supposed to remind them. “The Yellow Brick Road7” Why couldn't they have agreed on something less distasteful to their own kind and more representative of their currently elevated social status? Free at last! would have been much more appropriate and acceptable. Who am I to question this, though? It's their monument and they may do with it as they please. Just let me do with mine as I please. That would be the truer measure of equality! By the way, if so many don’t want to be reminded of slavery, why do they choose those chain symbol license plate holders for their vehicles. That doesn't bother me either, as long as I can choose my license plate holder!

On July 25, 2002, a scheduling conference was held in the Friends of Forrest vs. City of Selma, et al case before Judge Lee, Federal Courthouse, Mobile, Alabama. With the issues narrowed, the case has been set for trial on July 7, 2003. We anticipate discovery will start in the near future, with discovery being completed on or before April 1,2003. While July 7* 2003 sounds like an eternity from today, as we near the completion dates for the various phases the time will appear to have flown. The effort to this date has been time intense to overcome the stiff opposition mounted by the City of Selma and other defendants; however, the next year will require a

AlaRebs, preaching to a growing choir and congregation is fine and dandy, but a big hit list of newspapers needs to receive your words of wisdom.
Let’s target the awfulest pair on Goat Hill - one senator and one “representative” - then let ’em have it every way except with a shotgun from now until November, each one of us firing off at least one letter a week to condemn that scalawag pair while praising their opponents. This session of the state legislature (which wanted to trash Alabama’s Constitution) needs reminding: we are a force to be reckoned with. Let’s not have this defensive war drag on till we’re put six feet into sweet Dixie earth. It's now, November is near, it’s later than you think. Nominations, please...

Terminal Phase
At ancient Athens, only half the people enjoyed a franchise; all those others were slaves or foreigners. In America, electoral and jural suffrage having been granted to nearly everybody, over time our definition of a voter extended beyond the propertied, literate taxpayer. One man, one vote, good! Some still don’t get it. What went wrong?
Well, the belated wisdom that slaves and foreigners shouldn't be levying taxes and quotas against the ctvitos. nor telling them which opinions arc permissible under the First AmendtpenL is a start Let *4 move on. We’ve also been instructed by the foreign cadri;, in charge of our major media that simple democracy, or empowering people to vote themselves largesse from the state treasury, is the worst kind of government. That's half true. But equally noxious is this Representative’* form of redistribution; vote-buying euphemized, at best, as the welfare state. Whose welfare? Why, that of those world bankers in charge.
We, the rational taxpayers, observing ourselves deadlocked and being judicious, must find a way back to the future; which again disqualifies foreigners and slaves. It’s time to get past putting communism out to pasture along with its fuzzy-headed and unnatural phrase, “To each his needs, from each his abilities.’’
For such was a slave's mentality. Middle Latin's name for him, sclovus, recognized the central European Slav as an obedient servant; and suggests even now the futility of trying to teach self-rule to “former” communist states. Let us stop this invasion by foreign ideology and save our heritage.
No mere human creoles law. The divine will alone nods greater or lesser honors upon peoples accordingly as they suffer tyranny, democracy or some limited voting right between the extremes: an invention, a license to interpret justly - which isn’t for j the complacent. Discovery being what our jurisprudence is about, the solid citizen's hallowed duty becomes a slave's key to the former’s wealth.
The once and future vessel “Freedom!” sails forever between the Charybdis of beggars electing redistributors who would suck producers into that whirlpool under color of law, and the Scylla of monstrously wealthy speculators buying up government | contracts with “campaign contributions.” j Both practices commonplace, we note that a legislative assembly’s division into two houses affirms the higher law recognizing eternal symbiosis between rich and poor. * And there are other ancient extremes, as examples, anarchy and central planning. We must ignore the extremist who calls us die-hards for defending our sacred honor. Strapped to the mainmast, our ears stopped against the siren noises, we shall limit the rampant manipulator to one vote, same as every qualified franchise, and no vote on monetary appropriations for the freeloader.
Let us reestablish an Alabama poll tax, not just because it kept incompetents from ruining themselves by electing scalawags, freebies and immorality, but to assert once more our state’s sovereignty. The media will howl, foreign courts may “federalize”
I nominate State Senator Roger Bedford (lives in Russellville) of Senate District 6. which includes SW Colbert, Franklin, Marion, Lamar and Fayette, plus western parts of Lawrence and Winston Counties... big territory for such a little mind: one of Alabama's most powerful Democrats.
When Bedford ran for office the first time (and won) - a reporter on TV asked him about gun rights. Roger replied: “Me and my son go fishing all the time.” (Bad grammar as well.)
He introduced an “all new " Alabama Constitution with no gun rights in it.
He has been indicted on two counts of extortion* - and yet won the Democratic

our own troops, and the disenfranchised can be expected to riot on cue, but why wait for the inevitable? Go out and meet it! And if the stars should fall on Alabama midst so much spleen, let us hold out till self-rule shall again prevail.
To which end we might also declare our Moratorium Day immediately following Tax Freedom Day. the date on which we no longer work for Leviathan each year. In suffering zero taxes or interest during those 24 hours of withdrawal from an enforced union, we shall recall the state’s true and unsullied history, at the same time expressing Alabama's hopes and prayers for the furore.
Too many “laws” and not enough law! The opportunist wealthy and poor alike will forever invite federal invasions across the Potomac into the breach of “interstate commerce” until we stop that fifth column. So let us self-governed citizens acquire a line-item veto power over proposed bills. Impossible, you say? Friend, how did this Jew World Order arise from a blip on the screen to flood stage? It’s a propaganda thing, they have no real argument The tide is turning! Will you wait until it’s “safe” before joining our action? As one AlaReb laments, “Many heritage supporters can’t take repeated defeats like just about every other political movement in history has had to endure,” and remarks further: “If instant gratification is the object go shopping like everybody else.”
To avoid disrupting timely deliberation, such a safety valve must provide “cooling of!” mechanisms that limit filibusters and uninformed palaver — while reserving to each voter immediate participation in any veto referendum against changes to this fundamental right of the taxpayer. Elected government officials would be asked to pledge allegiance by contract to a special interest group they are henceforth obliged to meet: namely, taxpayers. And, should our all-too-comfortable justices rule the document invalid, a simply understood agreement has to suffice for the moment Many sitting judges, having committed the greatest betrayals of all, must now sustain the real lawk objections.
The engendering acts that are to replace today’s theoretic democracy with de facto self-government can be undertaken only after we redemptors acquire media access to the public at large. Until then, authentic reforms may be blocked by an existing monolith opposed to the idea of Alabama as a separate state. But sundry conservative philosophers have been chipping away, on AlaReb and other websites, at that once solid Big Lie, a modest beginning. Thus the truth emerges by degrees.
So let us have faith in the internet as our miracle instead of Israel’s, and that all this pornography, thump and hump “music” and psychobabble will pass. The powerful but vertical Zionist media hierarchy, its “tolerance” stretched to transparency, is losing ground (though not yet a firm grip on our public purse strings) to minuteman truths linked horizontally between patriot websites. We must continue praying for
nomination in the June primary! There have been predictions that if he wins the election he’ll be found guilty on those two counts and will have to leave the Senate. Not soon enough for me!
Secondly, for State House 1 nominate Rep. Jack Venable, owner of a newspaper (District 31; Elmore and Coosa Counties and lives in Tallassee) who could not understand what was wrong with rewriting the Alabama Constitution. His bills HB45-HB5I would have deleted the state boundaries and 1/3 of our citizens* rights, reworded imminent domain to the point where anybody could take our property, created a state bank (when the last one went bankrupt), and taken a bite out of the militia portion of our constitution.

Churchill was the Chief of Naval Operations for the British Navy during WWI. My source of info is a super book on the Federal Reserve Banking System, The Creature from Jekyll Island - A Second Look at the Federal Reserve (Reality Zone. $19 50). Chapter 12 is “Sink the Lusitania.” The ad from the Des Moines (Iowa!) Register (page 262) warns of the danger the ship faced.

Moratorium Day
guidance, discussing the imminent agenda and seeking forward motion, whether or not the ideas outlined herein are useful.
And this concept may be named online democracy, even while Alabama excludes foreign and slave mentalities at the same time listening to “racism!” chants from the logically challenged. Neither the multiplier Marxists behind the mediacracy nor their multiplicand clients wish to lose power. Why “democracy,” then? Because we're tired of being cudgeled by “representative” democracy, and have gained the means to bring government to heel.
When prevented from stuffing the ballot box by his usual practice, presumably the liberal aristocrat will still be voting; but only once, like the rest of us. And the key to enfranchisement must always lie there for those among his former shills who qualify tinder the lenient 1963 standards, which didn’t even require knowledge of Latin. Yes, believe me. I'm aware of the 24th Amendment. And also the 18th.
Let us keep the Alabama Constitution, never advancing reforms too swiftly nor remain so sluggish that the media barons outflank us. The information age can be ours or theirs; the devil is in the details.
Then let’s argue, establish and confirm the valid basis and parameters for checking global elitists via the institution of online democracy; not alone because it promises to restore self-government to those who, insofar as possible, pull their own weight without burdening others, but also that we might become more aware of, and exercise greater faith in, the higher mind bringing us each new miracle.
For lawfully guided reason is capable of uprooting this abortive subversion, driving on to complete hearings and appropriate legislative enactments. Those behind the “New World Order,” a game played with monopoly money, keep sneaking past “go” when they ought to be in jail. Treacherous bankers having counted on that stratagem working forever may now find “chance" threatening their “community chest.”
Such power will crumble once we make the point and it has sunk in, everyone being aware that the means is at hand for ending this media conspiracy and reclaiming the constitutional intents of our forebears. So, let the pioneers of online democracy take heart; we want it clearly understood that our purpose is simply to restore legitimate government
Adopting the latest communications technology for fail-safe accounting of all informational exchanges between citizens and their delegates is a first step toward the fully realized initiative and referendum. Once taxpayers get the complete attention of those representatives, we shall see new constitutional amendments; indicating the fear of meaningful action is receding, not that coming to terms with the internet has in some way unsettled our older sagacity.
Whatever course a society of self-ruled taxpayers may choose in the centuries ahead, whether to colonize the moon and Mars even as our Virginia forebears willed confederation with each contiguous state
in fulfilling a “manifest destiny,” should the adjustments foreseen here be perceived as threatening today’s Bildcrbcrg elites, this is bound to immediately trigger in their propaganda machine a storm of hysteria: RUBE ALERT writ large. Thus sicced into action, other “intellectuals” who've lately abandoned that defunct power base of the Big Lie’s misery (while remaining certain that “progress” emanates from themselves only, no cure being known for the liberal, one-shot, panacea affliction) might seek to “sanitize” the electronic communications network of these proceedings.
They’ll attempt any emergent means to spy on and gain control of the terminals, having been in the communications racket all along; which puts us patriots declaring honest opinions (while stalked by Sleaze Dees for key words) at a disadvantage. But let’s recall the Jeffersonian wisdom ever again: The price of freedom is vigilance.
This time there will be no Jefferson to compose the refinements and instruct us in what manner the authorized proxy agents might be identified fail-safe on every issue voted. The emerging computer sciences can, no doubt, eventually program existing technology to regularly insure the taxpayer that his will is made known to government at proper times and places according to his preference, either directly or by proxy, with online accounting verifying exactly how that individual franchise got voted.
Mao might call our coming victory over Vote scam and the mediacracy *s “Voter News Service” a Great Leap Forward -were he alive and honest, neither of which applies. We shall purge the devil from the details.
A program analyzing overall results in precise tabulations could even be made to activate bells and whistles at the home monitor station anytime a proxy defects or errs. The citizen elector, of course, would need occasionally to scroll through such data, confirming his government policy, making necessary changes and corrections to files and double-checking the terminal’s security against intrusion.
But ever so many safety mechanisms will guarantee nothing unless the termini*' sovereign takes notice of his social rights and obligations. The great middle class has finally to realize we’ve been deceived: it’s not possible for those multipliers to spend the world into prosperity, nor can illiterates vote themselves wisdom. This monopoly money which enriches the banksters with real property each time it changes hands also devalues our common sense. And yet, with the inevitable reckoning already at hand, somehow we still hang onto faith, pray, produce, invest and save. Why?
It’s a thing called conscience! Industry isn’t just about eating. What satisfaction in having a powerful portfolio if you've no virtue or legitimate purpose?
Let’s stop Bilderbcrg’s mad adventures. Online democracy is not for such failures. As Alabama's lawfully manifest destiny moves away from FDR's redistribution of confiscated goods toward principles, ours to push back the cyberspace frontier.
