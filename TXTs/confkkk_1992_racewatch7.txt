New law applied in black teens’ arrests
By JOE MARUSAK Staf* Wnter
LINCOLNTON — Using a new law designed to protect minorities from hate crimes, police on Thursday arrested nine black teenagers in what they called racial attacks on whites.
The youths face a total of |§ charges, including counts of comrnon-Iaw robbery and “ethnic intimidation “ The legislature enacted the law last year to protect minorities, and the Lincoln case is only the second time it’s been used.
List week, a Durham County prosecutor dismissed the charge against four white men accused of threatening a black woman because they had been convicted previously on related charges.
Limoni Assistant District Attorney Rick Shaffer said the charge, which carries a ty-^Tear prison sentence, af—~—!-J—sy>lv to black-oiv white racial crime.
|| attorney's office is taking the position th.-.t .11 racially motivated crimes are totally unacccpt-Shaffer said "There will be zero tolerance, which, means no deals. It doesn’t matter whether it's white aga.nst black or black against white.”
Police chief Terry Burgin said groups of black teenagers surrounded pairs of young whites on four
occasions, yelling at them, striking them and, in some instances, taking small amounts of cash.
- Police said suspects told them they wanted to frighten the whites, whom they picked at random in a local park, outside a bowling alley and other public places.
Burgin said one suspect told him he wanted to avenge the mistreatment of blacks by whites in the 1950s and '60s, Burgin said.
“By their own statements, they chose white victims simply because they were white,” he said.
The suspects include Lincolnton High School football captain Dion Lynch and at le$st two teammates, Venire** Williams and William Christopher Curry.
Police were still rounding up suspects Thursday night. They

were being held in Lincoln County Jail under $75,000 bond each, authorities said.
Burgin said he’s known most of the suspects since they were small children and said they came from good family backgrounds.
“It was the pressure of the group,” Burgin said..
Football coach Richard Smith said the charges surprised him.
“We were out of school last week, and sometimes young people don’t have enough to keep them busy," Smith said. “Sometimes when you’re in with the wrong crowd and with the wrong people, things happen.”
Burgin said the charges stem from these incidents:
■	Two 18-year-old whites were walking home from a downtown service station the evening of April 23 when a group of blacks confronted them, Burgin said. One white was hit in the back of the head and suffered a broken rib from a kick. Burgin said about $50 was taken from the youth's wallet.
■	Two white teenagers were confronted as they walked toward a bowling alley about 9 p.m.
Saturday. One escaped but the other was kicked and beaten, Burgin said, suffering cuts and bruises.
■	Later that night, two white men, ages 20 and 19, were attacked as they walked along railroad tracks. One was beaten and robbed of a small amount of cash, Burgin said.
■	About 1 a.m. Sunday, a group smashed the windows of a car in which an 18-year-old youth and 17-year-old girl were sitting.
Mary Peeler, executive director of the state NAACP in Greensboro, said violence such as in the Lincoln cases can result from frustrations among young blacks.
“Quite often when people learn about history, from slavery through the Jim Crow laws through the civil rights moyement, they will have serious feelings of frustration and anger...” Peeler said.
“But this does not give us the right to embark upon violence to address the frustration,” she said. □ □□
