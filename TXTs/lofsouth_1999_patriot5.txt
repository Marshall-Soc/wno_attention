4 MARCH 2000
The League of the South will hold a ‘Southern Independence Day Rally* on the steps of the state capitol building in Montgomery, Alabama, Saturday, 4 March 2000. The purpose of this event will be to declare our cultural independence as the first step toward the restoration of our complete political liberty. Throughout history, successful independence movements have almost always been preceded by cultural revitalisation, and ours will be no different.
By declaring ourselves culturally independent, we will emphasise the fact that the South is a conquered nation and the Southern people are subjects of an immoral and illegitimate American Empire. Moreover, we will unveil a ‘Declaration of Southern Independence’ in which we will tell the world that from this point forward the League and other pro-South organisations (indeed, we hope the entire Southern Independence Movement) will pledge ‘blood, treasure, and sacred honour’ to the cause of independence.
Besides the proclamation of our cultural independence and the pledge to work for complete liberty under God, we will also celebrate our culture and heritage in a most positive manner. Plans are to have music, vendors, and other manifestations of Southern culture. If you’d like to be a vendor, please contact the Montgomery Police Department at (334) 241-2773 to arrange for a permit.
If properly done, this event ought to give a great boost to the Southern Independence Movement as a whole. To do it right, however, will take the efforts of us all. At the very least, we expect all members to attend (and to bring friends and family). But just as importantly, we need your active participation in arranging it and your financial support to fund it. If you’d like to volunteer your services in one or more of the following areas, call me: entertainment, equipment (especially a public address system), security, media contacts, advanced publicity among other pro-South groups, re-enactors, decorations, etc.
After some problems earlier this year, things are now going well for the League. Recruitment is steady and, thanks to the efforts of James Gamer and friends in Georgia, member retention is also strong. I have also been encouraged lately by the increased numbers that we’ve had at some of our LS county meetings. For instance, in mid-September, we had about forty members present at the Lawrence County, Alabama, meeting, forty to fifty at the Simpson County, Mississippi, meeting, and about thirty-five at a meeting in Flat Rock, North Carolina. This, in addition to some very well-attended annual state meetings during the summer and early fall, should give us great encouragement as we head toward 2000.
On another front, the League of the South Institute, under the direction of Dr
Don Livingston, continues to grow. Besides our annual summer school, the LSI has already planned a number of‘Hedge School’ seminars and other local educational events all across Dixie. Also, the LS Papers Series has added volumes 3 & 4 to the list, and we hope to have two more papers out by late 1999 or early 2000. We have the 44-videotape series ‘The History and Literature of the South’ as well, and will be adding at least twelve more tapes later this year. If you would like to sponsor a student at one of the LSI events or if you know of a good locale to hold a weekend or week-long session, please call Don at (404) 377-0484.
Though we have reason to be positive about the growth and direction of the League and the Southern Independence Movement, we must understand that we are engaged in a long-term project. Patience and perseverance are thus crucial. Undoing the effects of decades of anti-South propaganda on our own people will be a time-consuming and laborious task. Undoubtedly, some of the more impatient among us will abandon the movement when they
dont see immediate and glorious results. This is a mistake. Those of us in this fight for the long haul understand that it is an everyday job, replete with successes and failures. The character of an individual as well as of an organisation is best determined by how he or it responds to hard times and slow progress, and these we will most certainly have from time to time.
I implore you all to persevere through this long, tough battle. After all, as Clyde Wilson asks, what better thing can we be doing for ourselves and our posterity?
As the intrepid Forrest reportedly said, it’s ‘war to the knife and the knife to the hilt.’ Deo Vindice!

Three millions of people, armed in the Holy cause of Liberty, and in such a country as that which we possess, are invicible by any force which our enemy can send against us. Besides, sir, we shall not fight our battle alone. There is a just God who presides over the destinies of nations; and who will raise up friends to fight our battle for us. The battle, sir, is not to the strong alone; it is to the vigilant, the active, the brave

Knight Ridder and Gannett
Second in a series on the newspaper press
contributed by Ambrose Gonzales Elliott South Carolina
Whenever the Columbia (SC) State bashes the Confederate flag, it often quotes from the Greenville (SC) News for support. Now, The State is a Knight Ridder chain organ, and the News is a Gannett chain paper. Both these newspapers in the state’s two largest cities are thus operated by outsiders, who seem to hold the people of South Carolina in low regard. Their preachy attitudes about the flag have never been confined to their editorial pages, but have shown up constantly and pervasively in every section of the paper. For example, on 8 September 1999, even the senior sports editor of The State, in a sports article, on the sports page got in the act by sniping at the flag and the people of South Carolina. He writes that South Carolinians are a “cantankerous lot” for continuing to fly ‘a 134-year-old flag’ while ‘people in other parts of the country look at us and scratch their heads.’ The only ‘sports* I see here is the pot shots the editor is taking at his game—his decent Carolina readers, who get ambushed from a most-unlikely quarter. Like hunted deer, they cant find sanctuary from The State's relentless hounding even on the sports pages of their hometown paper.
The snakey State was the subject of The Southern Patriot’s first essay in this series of articles on the newspaper press. Our second here fo-
cuses on the Greenville News, the Gannett empire’s ally of The State. Appropriately, when The State had a recent poll conducted on the flag, they co-sponsored it with the Greenville News, the Myrtle Beach Sun News, the Hilton Head Island Packet, the Beaufort Gazette (outside Hilton Head and home of the Parris Island Marine Base) and the Rock Hill News (outside Charlotte). Notice the trend: Knight Ridder, Gannett, New South retirement centers for non-Southerners, military bases, and a suburban satellite of Charlotte. About Hilton Head, I must quote here what Alex Sanders, president of the College of Charleston, said recently concerning the causes of the War Between the States. It was fought not so much over slavery, says Sanders, as to prevent the South from looking like Hilton Head. Enough said about the Island Packet.
The poll on the flag was conducted by ‘KPC Research’ of Charlotte. Only upon hard digging does one find that the ‘KPC’ acronym stands for Knight Publishing Company, and that ‘KPC’ is actually owned by Knight Publishing, the publisher of the Charlotte Observer, and that the Charlotte Observer itself is owned by Knight Ridder, who also owns The State and the Myrtle Beach Sun News, another co-sponsor of the poll. Methinks I smell a rat. So much for the likelihood of a disinterested ‘scientific’ survey done ‘independently.’
Chris Sullivan, editor of the Southern Partisan magazine, apparently also smelled the same rat. He is quoted as saying that he feels the polls may have been skewed to present the opinion of
3
the sponsoring bodies. Yes, Chris, it doesn’t take a rocket scientist to deduce this. Sullivan says he’s not convinced by the poll numbers: ‘I’m sure there are dozens of ways you can ask these questions to get the answers you want.’ And, I might add, very interesting ways to find 872 out of over 3 million South Carolinians!
Even with the strong possibility of a biased survey, 38% of the 872 people polled wanted the flag to remain flying over the State House. Another 29% wanted it honoured on the grounds of the State House; and only 17% wanted it removed altogether. An interesting 16% refused to answer. Many of these last were probably intimidated by the climate created by liberal journalism in branding anyone ‘racist’ or ‘treasonous’ if he dares to favour keeping the flag on the dome. Pollsters appear to know too much about their callers, and government, as intrusive and heavy-handed as it has become today, might give the average citizen pause. The rank and file is growing more and more cautious about giving out answers, especially when the illiberal liberal majority has made a point of making the issue a racially charged one.
Yes, Sullivan is likely correct is his surmise. And, further, it would be interesting to see the profiles on just who these interviewees were and, more importantly, what caused them to be chosen by the Knight Publishing Company Research group, especially knowing the pollsters’ certain and clear knowledge of who was paying for the study,

Fund-Raising Success ...
contributed by J. Scott Goldsmith Greenville, South Carolina
A full moon, hurricane lamps and a balmy autumn evening provided the atmosphere. I provided barbecue with all the fixins—all you could eat. League members, their families and friends, provided good conversation, fellowship and a $50 per person donation to the Presidential Pledge Fund.
The idea for this fundraiser/reception took root when Dr Michael Hill spoke at The Sons of Confederate Veterans monthly meeting in Greenville, South Carolina. He told me then that he travels a great deal representing the League. I also knew that he had resigned his tenured position at Stillman College to take on the work of the League full time.
It occurred to me that Dr Hill’s travel schedule could be a win-win situation for many people. If receptions were to be held for him throughout the South during his travels, money could be raised for the Presidential Pledge Fund, which pays his salary. At the same time, League members would have the opportunity to meet and talk with Dr Hill in an informal setting. He would also get the chance to meet and talk with the membership. In addition, these casual get-togethers would also be a great way to attract potential members.
I knew that Dr Hill would be in Asheville, North Carolina, on 25 September. I invited him to a barbecue supper at my nearby cabin for that evening. I then sent out letters of
invitation to League members and their guests letting them know that I would provide supper if they would provide a recommended $50 tax-deductible donation to the Presidential Pledge Fund.
I sent out 40 invitations. I hoped for 20 guests, with a goal of raising $1,000. We actually exceeded our goal, and were able to send the Mary Noel Kershaw Foundation cheques totaling $1,400.
Encouraged by this success, I asked Dr Hill if we could share this fundraising success story with other League members. It’s our hope others might be inspired to take part in this on-going project. All it requires is that you open your home or backyard, as I did.
If you are interested in hosting a fundraising reception, please contact the national office. They, in turn, will be happy to let you know when Dr Hill will be traveling to or through or near your area. They will let you know as quickly as possible, to give you time to organise your own fundraising reception.
But remember, this is more than just fund-raising. It’s a chance to meet and talk with people committed to the Cause. It offers a chance to relax, strengthen old ties and create new ones. Our gathering was capped off with a rousing chorus of Dixie as we stood around a crackling bonfire.
As one of the guests at this reception remarked as he reluctantly left, ‘This was great! This gave us a chance to really talk. And there are people I met
here tonight that I’m going to keep in touch with.’

LSI Summer Schools 2000
One of possibly three summer schools in 2000 has already been scheduled for 25-30 June (Sunday-Friday) at the Beersheba Hotel in Beersheba Springs, Tennessee (near Sewanee & Monteagle). The hotel was built in 1857 and is located on the picturesque Cumberland Plateau. Beersheba Springs was the residence of Confederate General (and bishop) Leonidas Polk, one of the founders of the nearby University of the South at Sewanee. Also, the 35th Tennessee Volunteers Regiment was raised here in 1861.
Tuition, room (double-occupancy) and board for the week is $495. We have room for only 30 students, so dont delay in reserving your space. Deadline for registration is 1 June 2000. Though we welcome older folks, we hope to fill the spaces available with students from high school through graduate school. If you’d like to sponsor a student scholarship, please contact the League office or LSI Director, Dr Don Livingston: (404) 377-2812. Watch for more details on this and other summer schools in forthcoming issues of the newsletter.
KNIGHT RIDDER (continued from p. 2)
In 1996, a survey found that 41% of those polled wanted the flag to remain on the dome, compared to the recent 38%. So, you might have guessed it, true to form and its nickname. The Snake has the laigest front-page bold headline in its issue of 27 September read: ‘FLAG LOSING FAVOR WITH SC VOTERS.’ On the basis of 872 interviews, the first sentence of the article declares that ‘South Carolinians feel more strongly than their elected representatives that the Confederate flag should come down.’ The message is aimed at fewer than a hundred legislators, criticizing them for being ‘out of touch’ with their voters. The unmitigated arrogance! To use an entire newspaper as a personal lobbying letter! Power certainly does corrupt. But such is the way with today’s managerial elite. The article continues with a distortion that amounts to an out-and-out lie: ‘The poll places the public at odds with legislators.’ Another of the headline’s messages is addressed to flag defenders. To them, the headline says, ‘Give up. You’re losing ground and are going to lose. Why fight any longer? It is pointless.’ The snakey Knight Ridder State, of course, has been saying that now for three years.
This kind of editorializing on the front pages has gotten so flagrant that one wonders if the editors did not study journalism with the boys who used to work at PRAVDA in the bad old days of the now-nonexistent USSR. Opinions should be kept honestly on editorial pages. That is the first rule of a free press. The respect the press has
enjoyed in this country (and that ensures Freedom of the Press) is based on this assumption; and when it is violated, such violation endangers that very freedom itself. So this indeed is very serious business.
But to return to the Gannett-owned Greenville News, the oft-quoted ally of The State on the flag issue, and a cosponsor of the ‘KPC Survey.’ An expose of certain practices at this paper, entitled ‘Just Add Color,’ appeared in the highly respected Brill's Content for March 1999. It was written by Brill’s staff-writer Jennifer Greenstein, who had formerly covered business and education for a bureau at the Greenville News in 1994-1995 before Gannett bought the paper in December 1995. She has since learned that the Gannett empire has mandated for all of their 75 newspapers a practice called ‘Mainstreaming.’ ‘Main-streaming,’ says the Greenville News' managing editors for features, is defined as a ‘positive inclusion of minorities in stories . . . about the weather, banking, or government.’ Sometimes, however, there are real problems getting these inclusions. One staff writer is quoted as saying he ‘probably made an extra 30 phone calls’ before tracking down an Asian astronomer in Utah in order to include a minority in a piece on the solar eclipse. When you succeed, he continues, you ‘put it on the tally sheet and send it to Gannett.’ Even more bizarre results come from this ‘constant search for minorities.’ If you have an appropriately ‘ethnic’ last name, the News will find you. Yuri Tsuzuki was quoted three times in 13 days—on the local jogging path (‘It’s inspiring to me’), on the virtues of
5
changing area rugs, and on an upcoming Elton John concert. ‘Never mind,’ writes Greenstein, ‘that Tsuzuki is not an Elton John fan.’
Gannett keeps tabs on each of its newspapers, spot-checking three to 12 issues annually. Local editors highlight the ‘mainstreamed’ stories; and Gannett rates them for their ‘All-American Contest’—the 1984ish double-speak name Gannett has given the ‘mainstreaming competition.’ In 1998, the Greenville News had the dubious honour of winning the competition. The paper’s executive editor e-mailed his staff his congratulations for a job well done. The News has implemented two rules in order to meet its quotas and achieve its high ranking. Greenstein writes, ‘Each section’s front page must have at least one minority quote each day... and all the stories that

Southerner 2000
The next census in the year 2000 provides a prime opportunity to clearly state who we are. Southerner 2000, a League special projects group, has established the goal of getting as many Southerners as possible to declare their Southern heritage on the United States Census. A section on the census forms asks for information on your ethnic background. Write in your ethnic background as Southern. Spread the word.

News in Brief...
EXECUTIVE ORDER 13083 ‘FEDERALISM’ UPDATE
In a previous issue, we featured a story about E.O. 13083, signed by Bill Clinton in May 1998. Because of public pressure, E.O. 13083, which would have destroyed states rights, was officially revoked. Now, however, it has been quickly replaced by a new, and as yet unnumbered, executive order that also bears the title ‘Federalism.’ This new E.O., despite some cosmetic changes designed to placate criticism, still would allow the federal government to do virtually as it wishes in regard to the states. According to investigative reporter David Bresnahan, ‘nothing in the [new] order prevents [a federal] agecny from enacting any rule desired. They are required to consult, encourage, and inform [the states] but the results of those efforts do not require the agency to follow any input given by elected officials. Despite all the consulting, agencies are not prohibited from doing what they choose to do.’ Moreover, a White House press release points out that ‘the Order makes clear that federal action is appropriate in the presence of a problem of national scope or significance.’ This new E.O. will go into effect in November unless Clinton is again forced to revoke it or unless Congress takes action to stop it.
CRIME REPORT
The New Century Foundation has published a study called ‘The Color of Crime: Race, Crime, and Violence in
America.’ Some of the major findings include: 1) Black-on-white crime is more prevalent than black-on-black crime; 2) Of almost 1.7 million interracial violent crime involving blacks and whites, 90% are committed by blacks against whites. Thus blacks are 250 times more likely to commit criminal violence to whites than vice-versa;
3)	Blacks commit violent crimes at four to eight times the white rate. His-panics commit violent crimes at about three times the white rate and Asians at about one-half to three-quarters the white rate; 4) Blacks are twice as likely as whites to commit ‘hate crimes’; 5) Hispanics are a ‘hate crime’ victim category but not a perpetrator category. Hispanic offenders are classed as whites, which inflates the white offence rate and gives the impression that Hispanics commit no ‘hate crimes’; 6) Blacks are as much ‘more dangerous’ than whites as men are ‘more dangerous’ than women.
As expected, most of the state-controlled media refused to cover this report, and only a few conservative commentators, such as black columnist Walter Williams, had the courage to write about it. The report can be purchased for $5.00 by writing the New Century Foundation, 2717 Clarkes Landing, Oakton, VA 22124, or by calling (703) 716-0900.
SOBRAN ON THE RIGHT TO SECEDE (9/30/99)
Syndicated columnist and Constitution Party VP candidate Joseph Sobran thinks secession (or the threat of it) is an effective means of keeping a tyrannical government in line. Sobran
writes: ‘Our ultimate defense against the federal government is the right of secession.’ It is heartening to hear echoes of the League position from columnist Sobran, who joins Charley Reese and Walter Williams as advocates of separation as a means of safeguarding our ancient liberties.
BATTLEFLAG RALLY
The LS will participate in a rally to support the flying of the battleflag over the capitol in Columbia, South Carolina, on 8 January 2000. Let’s not allow the NAACP’s boycott of the state and its continued efforts to remove all Southern symbols from public display to go unopposed. If the radical leftists win in South Carolina, they plan to go after both the Georgia and Mississippi state flags next. The Associated Press reports the following from black Georgia state representative, Tyrone Brooks: ‘Once we win in South Carolina, then we move the movement to Georgia. Once we win in Georgia, then we move that movement to Mississippi.’ So, no matter what state you live in, you'll be helping yourself if you help South Carolina. For more information on the rally, call the LS national office.
LS PETITION WINNER
The Tarheel State is the winner of this month’s competition in the LS Petition of Southern Rights with 140 sigantures. Each month’s competition brings higher and higher numbers into our fold of supporters. Congratulations to Mike Tuggle and his North Carolinians.

On Prayer Robert E. Lee (1864)
‘Knowing that intercessory prayer is our mightiest weapon and the supreme call for all Christians today, I pleadingly urge our people everywhere to pray. Believing that prayer is the greatest contribution that our people can make in this critical hour, I humbly urge that we take time to pray ....
Let there be prayer at sunup, at noonday, at sundown, at midnight—all through the day. Let us pray for our children, our youth, our aged, our pastors, our homes. Let us pray for our churches.
Let us pray for ourselves, that we may not lose the word ‘concern’ out of our Christian vocabulary. Let us pray for our nation. Let us pray for those who have never known Jesus Christ and Redeeming Love, for moral forces everywhere, for our national leaders. Let prayer be our passion. Let prayer be our practice.’

From the LSI Director...
Dear Friend of the South:
Please give your thoughtful attention to the League of the South Institute for the Study of Southern Culture and History. Our purpose is to form an association of scholars from different disciplines in higher education who are interested in exploring the ‘permanent things’ as revealed in the Southern tradition and to consider how what is good and noble in that tradition can be extended into the future.
The Southern tradition, stretching from Thomas Jefferson, through Calhoun and the Nashville Agrarians, to M.E. Bradford, contains a powerful critique of the errors of modernity—many of
which are parading before us today on stilts. Yet the colleges, universities, and secondary schools in the South are, typically, either ignorant of this tradition or mention it only to demonise it. The result is that most young Southerners today have no intellectual grasp of their own cultural inheritance, and many have come to look upon it with shame.
Prof. Eugene Genovese, a distinguished northern historian of the South and a man of the left, is almost alone among our cultural elites in condemning this increasingly successful campaign by the media and the academy to obliterate a distinctively Southern identity. In his Harvard lectures, he rightly described it as a ‘cultural and political atrocity.’ Knowing that error and evil progress, not so much because of the power of those who are its instruments, but because good people do nothing, some of us in the academic world have decided to do something about it.
I am a professor of philosophy at Emory University who has published
mainly in the area of political philosophy and the history of philosophy. My most recent book is Philosophical Melancholy and Delirium, Hume’s Pathology of Philosophy (University of Chicago Press, 1998). Over 50 scholars have signed on to the Institute’s mission and have offered their expertise and support. As we become better known more will follow. Our goal is to form an alternative center of learning for Southerners of all races, and all others of good will, that will critically explore the permanent truths contained in the Southern tradition. To that end our immediate goals are the following.
1)	To organise research and publication at the highest academic level. Two Institute scholars will have books out next spring of great importance. Charles Adams, ‘When in the Course of Human Events,' Arguing the Southern Case for Secession (Rowman and Littlefield); and John Graham, The Cause of Us All (John Sanders). Once Adams’s book has been read, it will no longer be possible to maintain the myth that has become part of American identity: that an evil South seceded to protect slavery and that a virtuous North invaded to emancipate slaves. Lincoln’s invasion was motivated by quite different (and morally unworthy) reasons. Both Adams and Graham are northerners. Graham is a member of the Minnesota bar and a scholar of Constitutional law. He was asked by Quebec to write an amicus brief to the Supreme Court of Canada on the question of whether Quebec has a constitutional right to secede. The Court concluded that Quebec has a

1999 Western Regional Meeting &
Southern Heritage Society Christmas Ball
The 1999 Western Regional Meeting of the League of the South will be held Saturday, 11 December, at the West Monroe (Louisiana) Convention Center from 9:00 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. Speakers include Walter D. Kennedy, Rev. John T. Cripps, and Dr Michael Hill. Rev. Steve Wilkins will preside. The meeting will be followed by the Southern Heritage Society’s annual Christmas Ball at the same location from 7 p.m. until 10 p.m. Conference fee is $10.00 per individual and $25.00 per family, payable at the door. Tickets for the ball are $15 per individual and $25 per family. For more information on the conference, please call the League national office: (800) 888-3163. For further information on the ball, call the SHS: (318) 323-3061.
conditional right of secession. This was even more true of the American states in 1860. Graham’s book demonstrates that the Southern states had a clear right of secession within the context of the American legal tradition and under international law. It was a firm belief in this right, as an American inheritance, that motivated Southerners to fight with such tenacity and to endure losses in proportion to population that no people in modem times, except the Russians in World War II, have endured. These books will be deeply disturbing to our cultural elites because they force a rethinking of the legitimating myths that have led to the destruction of state and local sovereignty and to the spectacular and unconstitutional concentration of power in Washington.
2)	To conduct summer schools for college students and advanced high school students, providing them with
the scholarly resources necessary to articulate and defend the truths of the Southern tradition in the academy. We have operated a successful summer school for four years in South Carolina, drawing eager students from the four comers of the union. We are now planning to expand. Our goal is to have at least one summer school in each Southern state. Some of these, in time, will grow into centers of learning.
3)	To use our professional experience within the academy to encourage, assist, and advise students seeking careers in teaching and research in higher education. Southern colleges and universities are no exception in being dominated by the suffocating atmosphere of ‘political correctness.’ Southerners alive to their cultural inheritance who wish to explore it intellectually now find difficulty in being admitted to graduate programs, and find it even
more difficult to secure a position in higher education and receive tenure.
4)	To promote the formation of study groups and other educational activities in the colleges and secondary schools (including home school networks) of the South.
5)	To educate adults in the community through our Hedge School Seminar program. (For more information, contact me and request a brochure.)
To accomplish these goals we need patrons who will provide financial support. The Institute is a 501 (c) (3) nonprofit organisation, contributions to which are fully tax deductible. At present almost all of our faculty and staff have full time positions in the academic world and can devote only their spare time. If a vibrant Southern culture is to be revived, we must win the battle of ideas being waged in the culture war we are now living through. The most important battle is being waged in educational institutions. We know how to fight this battle and are determined to do so, but we are greatly outnumbered and need support.
Those who do not live and work in the academy can have little idea of how bad things have gotten in the colleges and universities of the South. I have talked with individuals who look back with fond memories on their experiences during the 50s and 60s in major state and private institutions of higher learning in the South. They are deeply loyal to those institutions and give generously to their support. They have no idea how those institutions have

LS/LDA LONG-DISTANCE PLAN:
SAVE MONEY & MAKE MONEY FOR THE LEAGUE
LDA provides long distance services for a host of conservative, Christian, and Southern heritage organisations. LDA will place you with a long distance service that does not support anti-Southern causes. You will be guaranteed a minimum of 10%, 20%, 30% or more in long distance savings, or DOUBLE YOUR MONEY BACK.
In addition, each month LDA will donate 5% of your long distance usage (in the form of a check) to The League of the South.
If you are not happy, they will switch you back at no cost.
—	Businesses can switch their 800 number over and save BIGI
—	Dial 1 long distance service and easy to use calling cards with no surcharge per call.
—	Six-second incremental billing; pay only for what you use.
—	Not limited to League of the South members. Sign up others and help The League.
—	Generate monthly contributions from LDA to The League of the South to help advance our cause.
Based on a 5% donation from LDA to the League on an average $25.00 monthly residential long distance bill, the League’s commission is $15 per average contributor per year—a very conservative projection, since many residential and commercial monthly long distance bills are much larger than $25.00.
With 400 LDA sign-ups, the monthly commission to the League would be $500.00 and the annual commission $6,000. With 1,000 sign-ups, the monthly commission would jump to $1,350 and the annual to $15,0001 Please consider switching your long distance carrier to LDA. Call David Williams at (800) 535-0757 for more information or to sign up.

changed. I am appalled when I think of the billions of dollars raised in the South, through taxes and alumni gifts, that go to support institutions that have nothing to offer Southern students who seek merely a critical understanding of their own cultural inheritance. When in class they try to articulate their view of things, they are likely to be patronised or derided.
With the mere crumbs of that amount, the Institute can work something of a revolution in higher education in the South. Our students discover that they
are not alone; that there are scholars of national and international reputation who have thought through the deep issues of the age and who have penetrating criticisms of the fashionable self-congratulatory ideologies of the hour. We open before our students the lineaments of a different path of scholarship to pursue. Some will devote their lives to exploring this path and to sharing it with others. At a small cost we can open a door that seemed locked and provide light in what appeared to be utter darkness. The students will do the rest, putting the considerable resources of the university to their own use.
10
The next time you are preparing to write a check in support of an institution of higher learning in the South, ask yourself what that institution is doing to teach Southern students about their own cultural inheritance. You will most likely find that nothing is being done, and that the suggestion to change things will be met with incredulity and even hostility. If so, consider setting aside a small fraction of that amount for the only organisation in higher education that is trying to redress the ideological bigotry prevalent in Southern colleges and universities. It costs around $500 (tuition, room and board) to fund a student for a week of intensive study at our summer school. If you can afford a scholarship for a student that would be wonderful. The student would write you a letter about his or her experience. But any gift would be greatly appreciated.
Checks should be made payable to the League of the South Institute and should be sent to the Mary Noel Kershaw Foundation, PO Box 41012, Nashville, TN 37204. All inquiries concerning the educational activities of the Institute (including requests for brochures) should be sent to me at 478 Burlington Rd., Atlanta, GA 30307. Phone and Fax (404) 377-0484.
I hope very much that you will take an interest in our efforts to educate our young people through financial assistance, advice, and a good word to others you know who are of like mind.
Sincerely,
Donald W. Livingston, Director LS Institute for the Study of Southern Culture and History
Tales of Reconstruction
contributed by Rev. L. Carroll Pope Lydia, South Carolina
The following is excerpted from a letter written in the early 1920s by a kinswoman of Rev. Pope from York County, South Carolina, just outside Charlotte. Mrs Carroll, an elderly woman at the time the letter was written, well remembered the horrors of Reconstruction.
‘From the close of the Civil War in April 1865 until 1876 was a period never to be forgotten by those who lived through it. As a horde of Carpet Baggers from the North descended upon us and they, in conjunction with the meanest, most detestable creatures that ever wore the skin of a white man (I mean the Scalawag Scamps who turned traitor to their own people in order to rob them).
The negroes, having been freed and given the right of suffrage, were easily the dupes of these scoundrels, and were told that they were entitled to forty acres... and a mule, and if they could not get it any other way, to bum out the whites and take it by force .... While I dont recall any murder committed, they did proceed to bum hundreds of dwellings — Until about 1869 and 1870, there was scarely a night passed without a fire in some direction.
The people had become desperate under this state of affairs. Something must be done to protect themselves. There was brought about what was . . . known as the Ku Klux Klan . . . under the leadership of . . . tens of
thousands of the best men of the South
9
The influence of the order soon manifested itself by bringing about a wholesome change in the minds of the scoundrels who had been robbing us, and they began seeking other climes until the memorable campaign under the Red Shirts and General Wade Hampton in 1876 forever redeemed South Carolina [from]... Carpet Bagger and Scalawag rule.’

Editor:
By the time this goes to print we will have already known which way the wind blows in Montgomery in support of, or in non-support of, a new state flag bill requiring all facilities in the State of Alabama to fly the Alabama State flag. A copy of the proposed bill follows for all members of the LS aiid others to see:
A BILL TO BE ENTITLED AN ACT
|All city, county and state facilities supported in whole or in part by funds from the State of Alabama shall fly within public view upon the grounds of its property the Alabama State Flag, and it shall be flown upon a pole of its own, and at a height and of a size equal to, or exceeding that of any other flag which may be flown at such facility.’
Mr Lloyd ‘Cape’ Caperton and I want to thank all members of the League of the South who have pitched in with their help and encouragement in favor
11
of the Alabama State Flag Initiative. We would all do well now to keep in contact with our State Senators and Representatives even up until the last tick of the next legislative clock_
Members and residents both inside and outside the State of Alabama are invited to join us in a letter writing program to our liberal governor who has demonstrated a total lack of concern and even contempt over the display of our state’s flag. Write to Governor Don Siegelman, State Capitol Building, 600 Dexter Avenue, Room N-104, Montgomery, AL 36130-2751. Send him a copy of our flag Bill. Tell him you want his support for it. Ask him why Alabama does not fly its state flag ....
For the Cause, I am
Sincerely,
Walter L. Bryant, Director Alabama State Flag Initiative PO Box 164 Columbiana, AL 35051

KNIGHT RIDDER (continued from p. 5)
Greenstein writes, ‘Each section’s front page must have at least one minority quote each day... and all the stories that aren’t prompted by breaking news must quote at least one minority.’ These are the rules, and they are hard and fast. The paper keeps a list of 1,000 nonwhite sources. But sometimes even this source list fails. Last year, a reporter spent an entire day finding ‘a nonwhite to quote in a story on gourmet dog biscuits.’
The News managing editor and executive editor adamantly (arrogantly?) defend ‘Mainstreaming.’ One aim is
to ‘bring black readers to the paper.’ Greenstein concludes, ‘Even if that’s true, the gain hasn’t been enough to offset a drop in overall readership.’ Since Gannett acquired the News in December 1995, the circulation has fallen from 102,110 to 97,407—in spite of the very large increase in the area’s population—among the highest in the country. And the end result of Gannett’s quota ‘Mainstreaming’? Greenstein strongly suggests that it is most often not racial progress, but (in her words) ‘political correctness run amok.’
So the Greenville News must join The Snake (oops, The State) in America’s
rogues gallery of newspaper clones— the playtoys of newspaper empires’ illiberal liberals, their managerial elites, their social engineers, and their holier-than-thou panoply of statistic-loving social ‘scientists.’ So much for an intelligent, honest, free American press—an illusion at best, as Solzhenitsyn clearly saw and declared.
Ambrose Gonzales Elliott now reads both these newspapers at his local library—not wishing to finance their folly.
Presidential Pledge Fund...
The Board of Directors continues its special plea for support, from those who have already been so generous, for funds to allow Dr Hill to pay fulltime attention to the business of the League. We are asking for pledges for three years. These will be tax-deductible contributions to the League of the South Institute. Either 200 members pledging $25 per month, 100 members at $50 per month, or 50 members at $100 will guarantee the League can survive and go forward. Please return your pledge form for whatever you are willing as soon as possible. You will then be mailed a personalised ‘coupon book’ to simplify monthly record-keeping. The fund currently stands at about 85 percent of the necessary pledges.
