AIDS shows a return of biblical punishment
Bible study tells me that God rained fire and brimstone down on Sodom and Gomorrah. This was punishment of death, because of the sins of unnatural sex acts of immoral people in those cities.
Now, we have these type of people scattered in across our nation. Innocent
Commentary:
___________By	Gene Hall
people even become victims, while health officials run in circles seeking a cure of God’s plague on homosexuals, perverts
and lesbians.
The officials attend meetings and are so concerned about the “privacy rights” of AIDS victims, it appears that the names of the victims must be kept a secret from the public if possible.
These AIDS victims must be isolated,
placed on an island, away from the general public. We must be kept in good health with a long life span. We must be able to pay taxes in order to pay their salary.
It is time for a quick separation, now.
(Gene Hall lives in Snellville.)
