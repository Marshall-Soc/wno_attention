SURGEON OENERAL’S WARNING: First-time readers of alternate news, especially boob tube babies, may experience severe loss of confidence in the Establishment press and tube.
Speech and religion were already ours back when FDR named “four freedoms." But he would whip hunger, fear and oppression, abstaining forever from Europe’s wars.

Forbidden phrases, hidden history: those mediacrats are without heart
Mobile Mayor Mike Dow agrees to name April Confederate History Month. Immutable media morons, however, say Heart of Dixie and the Alabama Constitution have to go.
By Oiaf Childress
Those who once looked forward to “2001, a Space Odyssey" are getting this millennial “War of the Words" instead: a battle between mediacrats who expect their NAACP agitators (plus a few KKK plants) to generate sufficient "hatred news" - and unreconstructed Southerners like Dr. Ben George, a Saraland veterinarian whose aim as communications director for Friends of the Flag is to protect historic street names, etc., during Mobile’s Tricentennial Year.
“Our first annual Confederate Memorial Luncheon on April 4,2002,” says George, "will hear Mayor Dow order banners hung on the streets for celebrating Confederate History Month during April.” That’s news! And, since not everybody will praise his sensible if long overdue gesture, the more reason patriots ought to thank Mr. Dow for showing such courage - along with insight that the tide is turning. But let us condemn the ongoing duplicity elsewhere.
For instance, when black Rep. Alvin Holmes declared he would not retire from the State House until "Heart of Dixie” was completely removed from Alabama’s new auto license plates - even the tiny heart! -George quickly admonished: "Just like in South Carolina, compromise with 'cultural bigots' only emboldens them and leads to further demands.*"
That was in reference, of course, to the NAACP's refusal to be pacified on having forced the Confederate flag from South Carolina's capitol dome, bringing instead more conditions. Many feel the national association has advanced colored people to the limits of their capabilities; and, with its purpose accomplished, is now unwittingly alienating whites who’ve empathized with its once legitimate cause. Having shown patience and tolerance for Black History Month, Head Start, Kwanza, Affirmative Action and other mediae racy missions, whites are now - as Radio WMOB’s Kelly McGinley talk show bills itself - "Retaking America.” No, not from blacks; whoever's interested is urged to join the fight Real progress means removing the blinders, and, this November, booting from public office such freeloading phonies as have used the black community to its detriment.
This War of the Words has turned your tax dollars and mine against our interests long enough. We’re tired of it

For instance, that arrogantly sneaky and contemptuous license plate motto change the peecee crowd has come up with is too much: even for "Citizen John” Burke, chairman of Mobile’s March Against Crime, an organization which ordinarily takes no part in heritage issues. Said "C. J”, holding up one of those new Alabama tags at the March 14 meet: “They think we’ll just keep backing up? Those sorry money hustlers who use the black community wouldn’t stop at removing every one of our Confederate monuments, all the flags and symbols, including the word 'Dixie.’ Next, whoever's pulling their strings would send them agitating to have 'Alabama’ changed into 'autonomous region’ or 'soviet' of the 'united nations.’ How are we gonna retake the word Dixie? Here’s Ben George to tell us. But first, note how his decal precisely fits over the words, ‘stars fell on.’”
Dr. George at that point elaborated his
counterattack further: "This ‘stars fell on* was simply a way to begin removing ‘Dixie* from Alabamians’ car tags. Who can guess what words or phrases would next be the targets of those terminally politically correct? We are now issuing the Alabama car tag retrofit kit. The 'Heart of Dixie’ stickers, four to a sheet, are high quality vinyl with u-v-resistant ink, and should last as long as the tag. They will sell for a dollar the sheet of four stickers, or 75 cents on orders of over 100.
"We are seeking legislators this election year who will place a bill in the legislature giving people a vote, or at least a choice, between ‘Heart of Dixie’ and 'stars fell on.* We feel the legality is OK, but those with concerns can place them on their bumper or a license plate frame directly oven^stars fell on.’ We pray you will assist Friends of the Flag to find distributors in all 67 counties of our great state."
Other printers had also started offering "Heart of Dixie” decals, this “Retaking" obviously turning out to be no isolated, but rather a genuine Southern, “thang.” A vast, right wing conspiracy? Maybe; it depends which side in this War of the Words you’re on. Stickers being sold by one vendor at the League of the South’s state conference on March 9 in Montgomery even had a small heart beside the still official motto.
Along with auto-owning concerned citizens, "internal security” too found itself divided on this issue which your "regular” media remain reluctant to discuss: how best to handle “terrorists” who love Dixie more than they fear Bush the Younger. As the Alabama Coalition weighed in. Bob Bentley of Mussel Shoals opened up to his compatriots on March 4th with this query; "Y’all, 1 was just told by our Colbert County Judge of Probate that one could 'possibly* be ticketed for putting 'Heart of Dixie’ over 'stars fell on’ Alabama. So I proceeded directly to the sheriff, who called the Tri-Cities Post of the Alabama State Troopers. The Post Commander said that / could and would be ticketed for putting anything on the tag. Now, what am I going to do with this envelope full of stickers?”
“You need to read the law and determine if your trooper is telling the truth." replied Bill Beckham. "If not. put the stickers on anyway. Confusion to the Enemy!”
Bill Cox of Montgomery also looked for solidarity in this "retaking' of “Dixie
though! we were assurra the 'Mean or
Dixie’ retro-fit strip was legal. Certainly would like to know where we stand. I’ve already taken orders for 18 of them. Need a heads-up, please."
"Bill, I think the true question here is. was it legal for them to do what they did to (See "Confusion,” page 9)
TIM JAMES
FOR
CONSTITUTION
CHANGE THE GOVERNOR
SIGNS AVAILABLE AT KEEPOURRIGHTS.ORG Email fayp@aiawcb.com if you have frontage on a highway for putting up a large Tim James sign. We can't stop Vincent Fox from becoming co-president, but let's determine who governs our sovereign state.
Show time!
When you see the legislative report cards on pages 6 and 7 (our pornographic centerfold) you’ll know why we want those "representatives” scoring a dismal F out!
F as in flunky for the NWO! F for flip and F for flop! And, while these data tell the 1999-2000 session’s belated tale, none of the jackals scoring F have changed that much for the better. "Representative” Jack Venable, in fact, after earning a B in the last session, has flip-flopped and now leads the assault against our state constitution.
But we apologize to Republican Senator Bill Armistead, who scored an A at 100%, for our having berated his absence at a committee meeting recently. Turns out he was right, the meeting had been canceled; and secretly reconvened by the Democrats chasing two members hastily through for the bare quorum needed to approve one of Venable's venal bills (defeated later on the Senate floor by Armistead’s leadership).
Bill Armistead, Godspeed on your way to becoming Alabama’s Lt. Governor! □
Alabama is not D.C., Mr. Riley
Gubernatorial hopeful Bob Rileyl has been totally unresponsive to\ the lady representing our statewide organization which networks with many other groups and citizens across Alabama.
By Ellen Williams
President, The Alabama Coalition
We are concerned that Rep. j Jack Venable (D-Tallassee) has seen fit to gut our Bill of Rights and rewrite our constitution, as evidenced by his House Bills 45-51 to dissolve this state’s boundaries and chip away at the right to bear arms. And Mr. Riley is part of it: he is on record in favor of rewriting a perfectly adequate 1901 constitution.
Mr. Riley is running for the highest state office, yet takes the political way out of answering pleas by Alabamians who are opposing how a non-Alabamian Historical Director and a "New South” governor are planning to "reinterpret” our unique state capitol, a veritable gold mine for tourism, and make of it a politically correct shrine.
All I have heard Mr. Riley say is, "We did it this way in D.C." Alabama is not D.C., Mr. Riley. However, we fear it may begin to resemble the District of Cesspool if you get elected governor.
Answer the people's questions, Bob Riley.
ANOTHER PEECEE HAT IN RING
I spoke a few days ago with a 77 year old gentleman from Choctaw County and the conversation turned to rewriting Alabama’s
constitution. He seemed to agree raising taxes was one of the main reasons for that near hysterical outcry.
Saying he supports Steve Windom for governor, I explained that Windom wants to rewrite the constitution, too. This man came back with, “Oh, I don’t believe he will.” 1 replied, “He says he's for rewriting it, Mr. —. Either he is, or he’s a liar.”
1 further told him Windom favors a people’s convention, the most dangerous way to rewrite, as the voters will not get to vote on the document produced by a people k convention. And 1 added, "...like when the state seceded, that was done by a people’s convention, and though some (Winston County) remained opposed, the people had spoken."
1 continued, "Though, had I been living at the time, I would have been much in agreement with leaving the Union."
He demurred. "About leaving the Union, you know; I am a WWll veteran, and 1 just cannot imagine firing on an installation like they did on Ft. Sumter."
I said, "Mr. —, I can’t imagine soldiers in the uniform of the U.S. Army looting and burning homes, bams, killing livestock, stealing chickens, trampling gardens, even heating and warping hoes and plows and other farming implements of their fellow citizens either, but it happened."
And in conclusion, “Mr. —, if you like what you’re living in today, then for you the right side won that conflict of 1861-65. If you don't, then the right side lost." □

What To Do When The IRS Comes Knocking (Advanced Tactics 401)
uIf you’re happy and you know lU dank your chains!” The average American is silting in a mental jail ceil with the door wide open. Let’s spring them!
By Gordon Phillips
www.infbrmamerica.com
This article is not intended as legal advice, but merely as a guideline to proper and fun-filled conduct becoming a law-abiding citizen when the Internal Robbery Squad comes knocking at the door, asking whether you intend to file “overdue" tax returns, seeking amounts you are claimed to “owe," etc.
The following does not pertain to 4:00 AM jack-booted raids featuring machine-gun-toting Special Agents sporting fashionable new Kevlar body armor and black ski masks kicking in your door, stomping your .cat to death, shoving your pregnant wife up against the wall and causing a miscarriage, and so forth. Whoops. I got that mixed up with the BATF. Sony.
This article is about the IRS, and addresses the type of social call by Revenue Agents that the average American dreads to contemplate. After mentally arming yourself, however, this experience can prove invaluable in fortifying your sense of citizenship.
First, always remember that you are the Master (see the Ninth and Tenth Amendments) and that these uninvited trespassers are tax-consuming Public Servants. And never forget (assuming you’re still forking over your “fair share” of Marxist wealth redistribution) that it's your generous annual tribute that pays off the mortgages of these federal actors, that puts their kids through college, funds their retirement, etc. Hey, how much are they contributing to your lifestyle?
TAX TIP: All “good Americans,"
regardless of whether or not they still volunteer each year to commit financial suicide on a 1040 form, need to be prepared for the eventuality of the IRS darkening their doorstep. After all, they may have filed and paid... but they may not have paid enough!
Which means it’s time for a weapons check! No, put away that double-barreled 12 gauge, Verne. I’m talking about a functioning videotape recorder loaded with a folly charged battery and a fresh tape. In the alternative, a standard audio cassette or micro-cassette recorder will do. Note: the digital type of recorder is OK, unless of course the batteries should die, in which case you would lose your recording, which is why we still cling to our trusty old Radio Shack analog.
TAX TIP: Be sure to keep your “loaded" recorder right by the door, and take it with you in your briefcase or purse when out of the bouse. You never know when you might need to record other capricious acts of tyranny or selective prosecution, including routine unconstitutional traffic stops at “random roadblocks."
TAX TIP: You will need two (2) photocopies of Internal Revenue Code section 7608 on hand (more on this to follow). Again, keep them by the door, perhaps mounted in an attractively matched set of matted picture frames.
IRS agents usually travel in pairs so, as the joke goes, “One can lie and the other swear to it." When you answer the door and spot these characters on your doorstep (which, of course, could be prevented in the first place by clearly posting your property “No Trespassing"), you must immediately take charge of the situation.
NEVER under any circumstances allow officers of government (federal, state, or county) to enter your premises without a signed search warrant. They are trained observers and may make inferences about your lifestyle from your furnishings.
Before opening the door, especially if you’re a single woman living alone, shout out loudly behind you, “I’ll be right back.
boys. Just keep feeding those Rottweilers!’’ Anything similar will do.
Your visitors will expect your knees to knock and your jaw to come unhinged. Instead, throw them off guard by acting exuberantly pleased to see them (your impression of Marty Feldman as “Igor" in “Young Frankenstein" would work well here), stating that you appreciate the visit. “Did you have any trouble finding the place?" If you need to go get your recorder, tell them you’ll be right back (“Stay right there! Don’t go anywhere!"), close the door behind you and go get it
While they’re waiting on the front steps (with a little luck, it’s! raining), relax and take a few minutes to go make yourself j a nice, steaming cup of coffee, then go answer some e-mail J water your plants, whatever. Then grab your keys, step smartly and officiously outside and quickly close and lock the door behind you. Your impression of Peter Sellers as Inspector Clouseau in “The Pink Panther" would go nicely here.
Immediately obtain their full attention by whipping out your trusty recorder (already in “record" mode with the red indicator dot glowing) and pointing it right at them, explaining:
“You know, in spite of the fact that it’s incredibly rude and boorish to bother a busy person without an appointment, from what I’ve read in the papers lately things have been pretty rough for you boys, what with seizures down 95%, so anything I can do to help boost your performance bonuses will be just great! Consider it my patriotic duty. Actually, I’m so pleased you’re here because I’ve been concerned I wasn’t paying my correct “fair share." I”m sure you can help me determine what it is. You do have the delegated authority to do that, don’t you? Since I can’t possibly take notes
as fast as you two can talk, I'm going to record this conversation in case I need it as evidence of fraud and extortion. You have the right to remain silent Anything you say can and will be used against you. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford one, don’t look to me for help. Now, what can I do for you?"
Say all this with the genuine, demonic grin of a truly deranged individual, perhaps mimicking Jim Carey in “The Grinch Who Stole Christmas." If they don’t turn around and leave at this point as they often will, continue by asking:
“Could you kindly begin by stating your real names, not the aliases the Treasury Employee Union suggests you use to protect yourselves from potentially dangerous members of the pubic? Not that I’m dangerous, of course." Try to look like Jack Nicholas in “The Shining" as you say this.
If this doesn’t cause them to immediately flee the crime scene (if they’re running behind in their extortion quota for the week, it may not), ask them to prove their identities by producing their government identification. Tell them, “Your papers, please!" Your rendition of Sergeant Schultz in “Hogan’s Heroes" would be terrific at this juncture.
Explain that a local newspaper recently reported two escapees from a mental institution having been seen in the neighborhood wearing cheap suits, and they fit the description perfectly. Say, “One can never be too careful these days," doing your best Peter Lorre impersonation.
Make sure they hold their badges close enough so you can read the information out loud, and spell it slowly for the recorder. Also, state clearly the date, time and your present location. Then ask for their delegation of authority orders. Explain that they have no right to speak to you without clear authority delegated down from the Secretary of the Treasury ’Tight clear on down through your boss, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue."
If they’re still standing there looking like exhibits in a wax museum, you might
want to spice things up by asking, “Hey, do you guys know what happened to the defendants at Nuremberg who claimed they were only ‘doing their job’?" Then do your best Gene Wilder imitation, crooking your arm over your head as if holding a noose, cocking your head awkwardly sideways with your eyes rolled back and your tongue sticking out.
At some point about now, assuming they still haven’t fled, they may ask you a question. Never, EVER answer a direct question. Always respond with a question A of your own. Bear in mind that -^^agents traveling in pairs often display the “good guy, bad guy" strategy. If you observe this happening, ask the taller one:
“Say, I get it! You guys are using that old “good cop, bad cop” bit where one of you acts like an aggressive thug with too much testosterone while your buddy acts like my friend, protecting me from his tough partner , am I right? / love that bit! I saw it again last night on an old Cagney flick. Can you please do it some more so I can get it on tape?"
If they’re still standing there (man, they must really need that performance bonus), here’s an example of how some further conversation might go. (Role-play this type of light comedic banter with your friends and acquaintances until you find yourself comfortable fielding all sorts of inane, tax-related questions).
Agent: “We have no record of receiving a Form 1040 from you for the year 1999.”
You: “Gee whiz, I didn’t know I was required to file a 1040 on exclusively domestic sources of taxable income! Are you sure? Did you know that a former Commissioner admitted in 1993 that one in five Americans no longer files returns? Do
you guys still file?"
Agent: “All must file. All must voluntarily comply. Resistance is fotile."
You: “No kidding? Can you show me where it says that in the Law? Where do they wind you guys up, anyway? Can you show me the key?”
Agent: “We don’t have to show you anything. We’re from the IRS."
You (snapping to attention and delivering a crisp Nazi salute): “You don’t? Really? Geez, is this Cuba? Are we in Cuba? I thought we were still in the U.S. Hey, are you guys really from the IRS, or part of some new government cloning experiment?"
Agent: “According to our records, you owe us $20,422.39 in unpaid 1040 tax for the year 1999."
You: “Really? No kidding! I didn’t know 1040 was a tax. I thought it was a return. Can you show me where in the Internal Revenue Code Congress defined the 1040 as a tax? Wow, $20,422.39 sounds like about as much as you guys probably make in an entire year combined! How much do you guys make, anyway? Are you sure you guys are realty from the IRS? Hey, didn’t I see you on a recent episode of the “X Files"? Can you please go back to the office and put everything in writing so I can have my case worker at The Save-A-Patriot Fellowship reply under power-of-attomey? Did you hear how the Fellowship whipped your butts in court? Hey, come back, where are you going? I was just getting warmed up!"
At some point during this frivolity, stop, act totally surprised like Peter Falk in “Colombo" (as if you’ve just remembered something ... slapping yourself in the forehead is effective for emphasis) and ask, “Wait a minute. Wait just a gosh darn minute here! Does this visit pertain to SUBTITLE E?" (try to say “E” in two rising syllables)
They will have no idea on Earth what you’re talking about That’s why they’re working for the IRS. So explain to them that subtitle E of the tax code covers alcohol.
tobacco and firearms only. Ask them if they’re alleging that you’re involved in any activity pertaining to those areas.
If they haven't left yet, whip out a photocopy of code section 7608 and hand it to them, while reading from your own copy (now you know why you need two copies). Be sure to speak clearly so you get this all on tape for the record. It will also make for hilarious good fun when you play this tape at your next family gathering or church social.
Point out to them that code section 7608 is their “job description” - their sole, duly authorized function as revenue agents. Here’s what 7608 “Authority of internal revenue enforcement officers" actually says:
“(a) Enforcement of subtitle E and other laws pertaining to liquor, tobacco, and firearms. Any investigator, agent, or other internal revenue officer by whatever term designated, whom the Secretary charges with the duty of enforcing any of the criminal, seizure, or forfeiture provisions of subtitle E or of any other law of the United States pertaining to the commodities subject to tax under such subtitle for the enforcement of which the Secretary is responsible may - (1) carry firearms; (2) execute and serve search warrants and arrest warrants, and serve subpoenas and summonses issued under authority of the United States; (3) in respect to the performance of such duty, make arrests without warrant for any offense against the United States committed in his presence, or for any felony cognizable under the laws of the United States if he has reasonable grounds to believe that the person to be arrested has committed, or is committing, such felony; and (4) in respect to the performance of such duty, make seizures of property subject to forfeiture to the United States.
Hey, where are subtitles A and C? Ask them to let you know where it says
anything about income tax. xm&et sukAitkA At
or social security employment tax under subtitle C. All you can find in 7608 is subtitle E. What gives? When they act perplexed, ask them to read it again.
Remind them, “You know, fellas," this is your job description as written by Congress. Any activity beyond this would constitute criminal racketeering under RICO." Once the light starts to dawn, now ask, “Now which one of you wants to be listed first on my complaint to the Grand Jury foreman for fraud and extortion?"
If they aren’t running to their car yet, ask them “Hey, wait a minute so 1 can go grab my cell phone and dial “911" to report a robbery in progress. Hey, wait! Come back! You haven’t answered my questions! I need your office number and address for my criminal complaint!"
If possible, videotape them slinking (or racing) away to their government sedan and get the license plate number. Now hire a local private investigator to “run the tags" through the DMV computer and trace the car to the IRS office these actors came from.
Call them on the phone the next day and inform them that you plan to submit the tape to “America’s Funniest Home Videos" and you don’t need them to sign an approval waiver unless they want to. Tell them, “Your compliance is voluntary." Ha, ha.
Now run this tape on your local cable TV show for free under “Equal Access." Put up a web site and stream the video. Submit it to “America's Most Wanted." Call Geraldo Rivera. Show it at local gun clubs, high schools and flower shows. Use your imagination and you’ll think of dozens of other ways to use this primary source footage to awaken your fellow citizens to IRS fraud in action. Citizenship in motion is always good, clean fun. Now, go check those batteries!

HERE’S WHAT WAS IGNORED OR MISREPQRTED ELSEWHERE
Pancho Villa Highway from Tijuana to Vancouver?
COMMON SENSE IS HISTORY, as
LA RAZA SI, JEFF DAVIS NO. In case you thought the issue was going to go away quietly, think again. Remember those Confederate monuments honoring Jefferson Davis? News flash: Although the bill asking to have the monuments removed and the name of the highway changed died in a Washington Senate Committee, look who has joined the battle. The NAACP is at this time gathering signatures to present to lawmakers demanding the symbols be removed. They want that stone marker gone at the U.S. Canadian border in Blaine. It was erected in 1939 by the Daughters of the Confederacy dedicating Highway 99 to the memory of the CSA president.
“IT IS LUNACY, SHEER LUNACY, that the president would request, and the House would pass, such an amnesty at this time,” said Senator Robert Byrd March 18 to his colleagues in session. “That seems obvious to the American people, if not to the administration.**
INSIDE INFORMATION. Two of the candidates for Alabama's highest office disagree on what it means, but, according to Li Gov. Steve Windom's latest TV ad, one of his opponents in the Republican primary, U.S. Rep. Bob Riley who sits on the National Defense, Banking and Agriculture committees, profited quite well - “thousands of dollars** - when he bought stock in General Dynamics a month before the company was awarded a $4 billion Army contract for the construction of light armored vehicles. Windom's campaign manager said the ad reflected Riley’s own congressional financial disclosure report
CON-CON. Some just can't wait for a constitutional convention to rewrite Alabama's 1901 body of laws. They claim it's the best way to restructure taxes and avoid proration. But Prof, John Eidsmoe, prolific writer and taudhee el lam at Faulkner Uu&vuraity, told the League of the South's annual gathering March 9 that a constitutional convention would mean “gambling with Alabama's future.** The movement for a rewrite, he explained, is “a groundswcll by newspaper editors'* that does not accurately represent the feelings of Alabama's citizens. “There's an idea that this would he a convention of the people,** Eidsmoe said. “I don’t see it happening that way.” Robert W.

Few Confederate soldiers owned slaves; that was not the issue. Most of those other Africans, the ones brought to Cuba, Brazil and elsewhere, perished there under inhumane conditions. All thirteen U S colonies had slaves to clear their wilderness; but, when industrialization began, didn't need them, didn’t want them, despised them. The practice

WHITE HOUSE ACCESS. Enron’s chairman stayed at the White House eleven times, met with the president and vice president in the Oval Office. Enron gave S420,000 to the president’s party over three years, donated SI00,000 to his inauguration festivities, had access to the administration at its highest levels and even enlisted the Commerce and State Departments to grease its deals. The taxpayer-supported Export-Import Bank has subsidized Enron for more than $600 million in just one transaction. But... the president under whom all this happened wasn’t George W. Bush. It was Bill Clinton.
IN LEAGUE WITH THE PEOPLE! Alabama Chief Justice Roy S. Moore's written opinion denying custody of her child to a lesbian mother living with her partner in southern California has been praised by his state's League of the South executive director Steven Fitts. Common law sees homosexuality as an “inherent evil, and if a person openly engages in such a practice, that fact alone would render him or her an unfit parent," read the court’s unanimous decision granting custody to the child’s father.

PRIVILEGED CLASS. It is not hard to imagine the outcry if law-enforcement officers in any city in this country were caught red-handed planting evidence in a criminal case. Not only would the officers involved rightfully lose their jobs, they would be prosecuted and imprisoned. But so far there has been little made of a similar scandal involving the U.S. Forest Service. It seems five federal and two Washington State researchers conducting a four-year study of forest land across 16 states planted endangered lynx hairs in areas where the animals did not exist Why would federal employees do that? Quite possibly to put off limits large areas they wish to reserve for non-existent “endangered” species.
FIRING ON FT. SUMTER. President Abraham Lincoln - racist, destroyer of the republic and constitution - when asked, “Why not let the South go in peace?" replied: “I can't let them go. Who would pay for the government?" To coalesce the North’s forces, Lincoln staged that incident to inflame the populace, which it did. Drawing fire on Ft. Sumter was by his own admission a setup for just such action, for he knew provisioning the fort could provoke a war. His May 1,1861 letter to Gustavus Fox shows his delight with the result of that goad... “You and I both anticipated that the cause of the country would be advanced by making the attempt to provision Ft. Sumter, even if it should fail; and it is no small consolation now to feel that our anticipation b justified by the result."	-www.freeflorida.org

here except for Scotland, Ireland, Wales and England. Ours is an English speaking Christian nation of common sense. Yet Emperor Bush, supposedly a Christian, approves an open borders invasion of Mexicans, Muslims and third worlders. Since that 1965 Yankee immigration policy, the only ones having difficulty coming here are Europeans. Mr. Bush suddenly invites Muslims into the White House, encourages their building of mosques across America. No common sense at all! Try preaching our traditions to a Muslim country! The federal government has reneged on its contract. Alabama has to defend its own borders. We have always seen Southern whites and blacks, plus others who’ve assimilated, as no danger.
But today k fanatics lacking common sense will let in an unassimilable invasion without precedent If we don t stop it now. Lee, Jackson, Davis and Forrest can’t do it; they are heroes, yes; heritage defense is important, yes. But it's our fight here and now. We can shed this yoke of empire, and we shall do what common sense demands. We must do it now. We must fight. Reach!"
And here’s my two cents worth: Praise for those in the adjacent State House who voted against “Representative” Jack Venable’s pernicious constitution-bashing bills that same week; for the turncoats, unemployment come November. □

Mobile, what next?
Council President Copeland: *7 didn't know such a committee existed until last weekI"
By Nick Jongebloed
I don’t know if the Mobile Register's “correction policy" applies to his columns, but, in the interest of truth, I would like to point out editor Michael Marshall’s Sunday, January 27 error regarding Mobile’s city council supermajority rules: “So Mobilians voted to adopt the kind of government used by most mid-size cities in America: the mayor-council form.”
This is false! As was published, even in the Register; according to Bill Hansell (Executive Director ICMA, a professional and educational organization for administrators and assistant administrators serving cities/counties) in a Your Word piece some months back, the majority of cities with more than 100,000 citizens use the council-manager (CM) form of government. Wouldn’t Mobile love to be in such company? (Phoenix, San Diego, Dallas, Cincinnati, San Antonio, Kansas City, Norfolk, Savannah, Charlotte, Austin, Fort Worth, Spokane, Minneapolis, Atlanta.)
It may be of journalistic value to briefly explore the history of several municipal models. Cities in the early 20th century were moving toward the commission form, which originated in Galveston. After a catastrophic flood there, the governor of Texas named a five-member commission to take immediate action restoring the city. That was relatively simple to execute, both legislative and administrative powers being consolidated in the commission as a whole. So successful its rapid restoration of city services, the voters elected to make it permanent in 1903. Hundreds of other cities followed Galveston’s lead, including Mobile, which switched to the three-member commission in 1911.
As a result of this reform movement sweeping the country, the council-manager
my ■!—»■ off* tow* m —- ■■'■■■	»	—	—	fc-	——	«,
was instituted in law by Staunton, Virginia
in 1908. Today more than 3,700 cities have this form, as well as 370 counties; and the number has been growing at the rate of one a week for the past decade.
Those who oppose any change to the present “supermajority” proviso (requiring five of seven votes to pass council actions) maintain the current system has operated with few complaints. That’s because those of us who knew about the “supermajority” also recall how it was concealed from the voters in 1985, in which year this mayor-council form was selected by the voters.
That hidden supermajority rule wasn’t the only thing kept secret. Astonishingly, recently elected members to the council -Ben Brooks, Connie Hudson and Stephen Nodine - have discovered just how the distribution of tens of millions of dollars in Federal Community Development Block Grants, about $3.5 million annually, have been manipulated. It seems these funds have been under the control of a “secret” committee of the three black members (now Johnson, Richardson and Sullivan) since 1985. The current council president, Reggie Copeland, was quoted in the Mobile Register as saying he “didn’t know such a committee existed until last week” (first week of February 2002); this from a member serving since 1985, the same year that “committee” was established.
This secret cabal distributes millions within the predominantly black districts, thus insuring their reelection indefinitely. As ever more of these secrets are revealed by the newly elected members, citizens of Mobile should awaken to the need for a better way: the council-manager form of city government.	□

President. The League of the South The League of the South stands against illegal immigration and the liberal-socialist nightmare of multiculturalism. We believe that most Southerners do also. Unfortunately, it came a step closer with that 275-137 vote of 12 March in the U. S. House of Representatives for the Section 2451 Extension Bill, which grants amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants (mostly
Mexicans) now living in the United States. But the recorded vote shows one thing quite clearly. While the South (Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and West Virginia) voted against the Bush-supported measure 76-71, the rest of the nation voted for it by an overwhelming 204-61. Thus, against the will of a majority of Southern representatives (and we suspect an even greater majority of the Southern people themselves), illegal immigrants and their leftist supporters in Mexico and the U.S. (e.g. La Raza Uni da, Atzlan) have been given greater latitude to continue their Reconquista of North America. Moreover, a two-thirds majority in the House has told the American people that they and the corrupt and inefficient Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) are unwilling to police our borders against the continued threat of terrorist attacks.
This is not the first time that the South has voted differently (and we believe rightly) on the immigration issue. In 1965, both the U.S. House and Senate passed the Immigration Reform Act that threw open the doors to massive Third World immigration. In that vote in the House, the South stood 75-34 against the measure, while the nation voted for it by an overall total of 318-95. In the Senate, Southerners voted against the act by a margin of 15-10 while the overall Senate approved it 76-18. We see the same pattern in the vote on the Immigration Reform Act of 1986 (which
also provided amnesty to illegals). The overall vote in the House was 238-173 in favor of the act; the South voted 70-49 against it. The 1990 Immigration Act, which increased illegal immigration by some 40%, saw Southern representatives vote it down by a 60-54 margin while the House as a whole approved the law 264-118.
The sectional nature of the vote on Section 245i on 12 March is best illustrated by comparing the vote in the Deep South States (Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina) with that in New England (Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont). The Deep South voted against amnesty for illegal immigrants by a margin of 26-9 while New England voted for the measure 21-1. When the favorable vote in the Far West (62-14), Midwest (59-20), and the mid-Atlantic states of Delaware, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania (49-14) is factored in, we see just how wide is the gulf that separates the South from most of the rest of the country (remember the now-famous red and blue map from the 2000 Presidential race?)
The League of the South believes this vote, in conjunction with similar votes over the years on gun control, abortion, and other
orm a\0mu
El Dubya
pressing issues, provides a stark reminder that an independent South would have drastically different (and better) laws. It is certain that at present the Southern people have laws made for them that do not suit their more conservative world view. Therefore, we call upon the Southern people to seriously consider the merits of political independence. The alternative may be that we lose both our liberty and our country. □

U. S. Constitution is “Missing in Action”

The “Constitution of the United
StMmr" Arms aeH been in effect since
April 12,1861. That is a fact By R.E. Sutherland
Published in The Edgefield SC Advertiser Much 2002
When the Civil War was declared in 1861, President Lincoln began the horrific invasion of the South against all constitutional privileges to withdraw from the Federation. This fret is fully documented and explained by a Canadian author, Charles Adams, who wrote the book. When in the Course of.Human Events.
Let us be very clear - the Civil War was fought for States* Rights and against Northern levied unfair tariffs. Karl Marx, communist and author of “The Communist Manifesto** wrote, “North and die South is a tariff war. The war is further, not for any principle, does not touch the question of slavery, and in fret turns on the Northern lust for sovereignty.**
What happened to the Constitution in 1861? The first action taken by Lincoln and his henchmen was to throw editors into jail if they dared to disagree with his tactics, thereby creating his own propaganda machine. This same machine is in effect today via our school textbooks, the press and media, the public school teachers, and all other federal agencies.
Adams says, “Lincoln was not interested in having Congress take up the issues raised about secession and the Fort Sumter affair. By the time Congress convened, he had the army fully mobilized and had plans to invade the South. Public discussion, free speech, and a free press were strangled by Lincoln. He became master of the lives of men captured from the Confederacy, and he was fully prepared to hang them, especially those seized on Confederate ships - they were pirates under the law as he saw it Lincoln was thus an imperial magistrate, with full despotic powers, and his rightful master, the Congress, was not allowed to say anything or deckle the issues.**
Lincoln suspended the right of habeas corpus which was one of the most impor-
about Lincoln's rise to dictator by saying. “There is no Parliamentary (congressional] authority whatever for what has been done. It has been done simply on Mr. Lincoln's fiat. At his simple bidding, acting by no authority but his own pleasure, in plain defiance of the provisions of the ConstiT tution, the Habeas Corpus Act has been suspended, the press muzzled, and judges prevented by armed men from enforcing on the citizens* behalf the laws to which they and the President alike have sworn.** Adams wrote, “The Supreme Court made a valiant effort to check this reign of tyranny. In the case of Ex Parte Merryman (1861), a citizen of Maryland, John Merryman was arrested at night in his home and imprisoned at Fort McHenry under the orders of General George Cadwallader, commander of the fort From his military prison, Merryman petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus to Chief Justice Robert B. Taney, whose circuit included Maryland. Taney granted the writ and set a date for a hearing, but neither the general nor Merryman showed up. Instead, the general sent a letter to the Chief Justice explaining his actions and citing the decree of President Lincoln suspending the writ, which meant that Merryman could languish in prison forever, if the general so decided, with no right to a trial or an inquiry into whatever charges the general decided to make.*'
Adams records, “In response to the general’s letter. Chief Justice Taney ordered federal marshal Washington Bonifant to bring the general before the court on the next day along with the prisoner. Bonifant went to Fort McHenry, but the soldiers refused to admit him. The marshal had legal authority to summon a posse to arrest General Cadwallader and bring him into court, but this would have produced an armed conflict and bloodshed. Taney had no other recourse but to write his opinion and send a copy to President Lincoln who ignored the writ; Merryman remained in prison.
.. Taney wrote a blistering opinion.
violated the Constitution and that only Congress can suspend the writ of habeas corpus. If Lincoln's actions were allowed to stand, said the Chief Justice, then ‘the people of the United States are no longer living under a Government of laws, but every citizen holds life, liberty and property at the will and pleasure of the army officer in whose military district he may happen to be found.*
“Lincoln not only ignored the Supreme Court's ruling, he then wrote out a standing order for the arrest of the Chief Justice, who was then in his eighties. The arrest was never made. But one wonders how Lincoln, who justified the war on the South because of his duty to enforce the law, could in good conscience turn around and flout the Supreme Court and its court orders and rulings on the Constitution, which he was bound to obey... Taney’s opinion irritated Lincoln, especially when the Chief Justice had a copy served on the president.**
The end of the Civil War did not restore the Constitution of the United States. The Northern congressional leaders insisted that the Southern states had been captured, and therefore should be treated accordingly. One outstanding example of this activity happened in North Carolina. The elected Governor of North Carolina was removed from his position and a Northern-selected general was set into that position. A leading expert for this event is John Ainsworth who resides in North Carolina and is trying to educate the state’s citizens about who is actually in charge of their state government The Reconstruction Acts were exactly what they are called. They permanently removed the constitutional rights of the Southern states.*
When cases concerning constitutional issues are presented to the state and federal supreme courts, there appears to be a smoke-and-mirrors game. The citizen states what is written in the constitution, the justices agree. “Yes, it does say thaL** Then the justices go about making up whatever law they want to obey. They are
filing is happening with state constitutions.
Herein lies the future for the United States of America. Our elected officials are not tethered to the constitutional precepts that everyone assumes are in effect. There is no constitutional law. At this point in history, the Constitution of the United States has been missing in action since April 12, 1861.

From: nwaller@carol.net
On this matter of the South having “lost**... Folks, I beg you to remember to put our cause and our record in the most positive light at all times. This is not hype or P.R.. much less dishonesty; it’s the first sign of mental health. Personally, I don’t necessarily think it*s even true that the South lost. An unjust law is null and void ab initio. Does an illegitimate “victory** indeed stand - especially as its facade of respectability unravels day by day, hour by hour? A letter [that] made the rounds last week... was roundly applauded despite its having (in ray opinion) mostly said, “Yes, we lost, we lost, we lost; and we all know it, and it’s pitiful, and we wish the liberal PeeCees would please allow us occasional enjoyment of our C-flag and other shopworn cultural tokens.**
Folks, these people are wild animals that want to eat us for dinner. They understand one thing only - raw political power - and just spit at our attempts at negotiation and diplomacy and ’umbleness. You don’t tame a lion by sticking your head in his mouth, you do it with whips and gunshots or you are, as they say in the vulgar tongue, dead meat.

LEGISLATIVE REPORT CARD
Here’s a wrap-up of the session and it looks like most of them have flunked again. What did you expect from NWOflunkies? We must vote these perennial failures OUT.
By Terri Fulton
Member, Alabama Coalition Board of Directors
tfiiltonQcotnpanctJiet
MONTGOMERY -Senator Jim Freuitt (D) having expedited these three bills onto the Senate Special Order Calendar (!), here's how they voted gun protection and boundaries on March 12. Legislation like this is treasonous.
HB46 would delete our state boundaries.
HB47 would put boundaries in a statute.
HB50 was the first step in removing our rights to protect family and neighborhoods in case of a local 9-11.
BOUNDARY DETAILS
Before 1 list how they voted HB46 you must know that Senator Albert Lipscomb (R) saved us!! Lipscomb is running now for a U.S. seat. He didn’t just filibuster these bills regarding boundaries, he actually told the floor that our boundary description goes back to 1819: that there have been previous disputes between Alabama, Florida, Tennessee and Georgia, and now there is no controversy; everybody is happy. Those lines have been to court, nailed down, no more controversy. He spoke of Claude Arnold, WWII and the EUicott Stone on the 31st parallel — how Arnold measured and accurately remeasured; and how land surveyors didn t even want HB46 and HB47 (as testified to committeeY
On the opposite side pushing this bill, Senator W. H.“Pat” Lindsey (D) was rude and obnoxious. ‘Those are just a bunch of words,” he said, “inaccurate and ineffective. Alabama has no authority to set boundaries; that’s the federal government’s business.” Yes, you read that right Lindsey thinks the federal government has authority to set our boundaries; now you see why we have problems!
Senator H.E.“Hap” Myers, Jr. (R) spoke on boundaries: “Why remove?” said he. “There’s no good reason to take them out.” Senator Larry Dixon (R) likewise urged keeping our boundaries. (Senator Lindsey has got to go.) Senator Lipscomb needs to hear thanks from all of us. With help from Myers and Dixon, this well-respected legislator made the difference and literally saved the boundaries. Thus HB46 was not killed outright but rather confined to the Regular Order Senate Calendar, meaning it could have come up again. Requiring 21 votes to pass or fail, the vote was 16 to 12.
Voting YES: Barron, Bedford, Clay, Enfinger, Escott-Russell, Figures, Langford, Lindsey, T. Little, Z. Little, McLain, Means, Roberts, Sanders, Smitherman, Steele.
Voting NO: Biddle, Butler, Callahan, Denton, Dixon, Holley, Lee, Lipscomb, Mitchem, Myers, Smith, Waggoner.
Absent: Armistead, Dial, French.
Did not vote: Marsh, Mitchell, Poole.
Senator Freuitt got there late, and was shocked that his move had failed.
RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS
HB50, a little more complicated, would have removed two paragraphs from Article XV of the Alabama Constitution. I was too upset from fear to take notes! Senator Lipscomb explained how this bill would remove the ability to protect a family, its right to bear anqs, and could affect hunting, skeet shooting groups, reenactments, etc.
Senator Lindsey replied to Lipscomb, saying that if the people formed militias to take care of their community, the “federal government would come and squash you.” Lindsey has got to go! The vote on HB50:
Voting YES: Barron, Bedford, Clay,
Enfinger, Escott-Russell, Figures, Langford, Lindsey, T. Little, Z. Little, Marsh, McLain, Poole, Pveuitt, Roberts, Sanders, Smitherman, Steele.
Voting NO: Biddle, Butler, Denton, Dixon, French, Holley, Lee, Lipscomb, Mitchell, Mitchem, Myers, Smith, Waggoner.
Absent: Armistead, Dial. Did not vote: Callahan, Means.
You read it right: Senator Del Marsh, a Republican -“representing” District 12, Calhoun County - has got to go! The vote was 18-13; three more votes and gun rights, reenactments and family protection would have taken a big hit, the beginning of the end for our last lines of defense!
We are in big trouble, Alabama. Our servants who won’t protect our rights and listen to us must go. We’ve had enough!. Several citizen groups got together after this vote. The Alabama Coalition will keep you informed here on how to take care of our problem in Alabama. This will be our last chance to save ourselves! Watch for further posts. You can start now by putting the word out on how these senators voted, especially the one for your district
And let it be known that your calls, emails and faxes helped Senator Lipscomb tremendously with the votes he received against these two bills. We understand their phones rang off the hooks on HB50!
LETS CLEAN HOUSE!
If the ice hasn’t been broken, we’ve put cracks in it that are so good for all of us. I now see Southern-group individuals and grassroots Southern-politics types starting to get involved with each other's issues wherever our interests have been frozen
out, with both realizing the importance of
saving liberty o^rnoo oil linM an«>Mlo<«*
we’re being bombarded. Go, team!
I’m getting feedback from contacts that visit Montgomery on a regular basis. We’ve definitely been noticed; not necessarily as a group, though. Their cages are being rattled from Southern history to gun rights to states’ rights to the watersheds (ADEM/EPA) - by the pipeline’s new bill ' fighters; by flags, more flags, etc.
I have had posts from and to leaders of at least six different groups myself, and members of these groups; my needing them and their requiring info in return. There is a great possibility that we can make a big difference in some elections. 1 would like to see the incompetence and incoherence gone from our State House. What a dam vacuum that would create! An implosion!
If your group or any of its members will be trying to unseat at least one of them in a local district, let's get our organizations, or part of the members, working in unison and try to do a few county/city/statewide sweeps. As this session ends, I hear the governor talking special sessions, but find that hard to believe in an election year when all want to go out campaigning; so we can momentarily stop fighting for our very Southern lives.
The Alabama Coalition is mailing out questionnaires at present to all announced candidates. In the meantime we need to move against most of the incumbents. Of course, during the next legislature, we’ll have to keep after them; but if they know we helped dump the incumbents and got them elected, they'll pay closer attention when the coalition speaks. It appears to me that a good, informative leafleting of an incumbent’s area does wonders - better than anything else I can think of besides bad media. Are any of you planning on, or working toward, ousting a few incumbents? If so, we would like to compile the info in this space, monitor your progress, call for and help muster troops, and pass the word: from the planning to the outcome, what each person or group is aiming for. Let us
clean house.
We know Tim Meadows is a first-time candidate, for instance. Who is helping point out the incumbent’s history for that district? [See “Representative” J.E. Turner (R), page 6. -Ed.] I understand “Rep.” Venable’s base vote and home town has been leafleted already, and with apparent success! We find that, in the House, only one vote got cast against HB46 (state boundaries removal) - by Representative Riley Seibenhener (R), who is not running for reelection; which leaves everybody to sweep except maybe Republican Senators Armistead and Lipscomb, plus Democrat Bobby Denton who voted NO in Senate Committee on Venable’s entire package of House Bills 45-51.
Please join us with any information, ideas or suggestions. We ore on a roll, let’s keep going. What do you say? Narrowly having escaped our loss of state boundaries. Southern heritage and gun rights, we will be fighting further erosion of state sovereignty even more so in the next session - and it won’t be an election year! So, because we cannot continue to stay in Montgomery babysitting those we pay, let’s concentrate on replacing the state senators listed below in this election. I beg your comments, thoughts and participation in any way; we don’t have much time. But it can be done, if you all participate. Here’s why:
■	No legislation can be passed without going through the senate.
■	There are only 35 senators vs. 105 reps.
■	Seven have notable baggage and could be replaced (this is where we come in).
■	One has the Southern history people highly po’d (Means).
■	Nine would be more difficult and, at this time, they have no opposition.
■	Many with no announced opposition
are from hunting areas, yet voted to take
our gun rights and state boundaries away.
■	Nine double dippers: Unconstitutional!
Alabama'Coalition discussion table, all involved from the beginning, that have decided we must go on the offense: replace
these senators wherever possible in this election. Here’s the draft of targets to be replaced with our own people that we know. Or, you run! Further exciting ideas we will not mention at this time are in the mill. Everyone is welcome to participate. If you cannot attend one of our meetings, send a group leader or responsible member. If no one can attend because you are too far, just e-mail me which senators you want to help replace and what you’re willing to do. I will update you on our decisions from the meetings also. So far, this hit list is:
■	District 1 DENTON. We are looking at John Hargett
■	District 2 BUTLER Republican opponent Steve Andrews has been contacted with no reply as yet
■	District 3 ROBERTS.
■	District 4 ZEB LITTLE.
■	District 6 BEDFORD.
■	District 7 ENFINGER
■	District 8 BARRON.
■	District 10 MEANS.
■	District 11 PREUITT.
■	District 13 DIAL.
■	District 14 (Armistead’s old spot; three running Republicans). We’re looking at Hank Erwin, Jr.
■	District 16 WAGGONER
■	District 21 POOLE.
■	District 22 LINDSEY!!!
■	District 23 SANDERS.
■	District 27 TED LITTLE.
■	District 30 MITCHELL.
■	District 31 HOLLEY.
District 32 (Lipscomb’s old spot). District 34 MYERS.

An unreconstructed debt to the past
Citizens are free to guide the State of Alabama in a sensible direction. Join the action.
By Ellen Williams This new monument, placed in early February by the Prattville Dragoons SCV Camp, was removed March 12 from the school grounds by Autauga County’s Board of Education on veiy short notice to the SCV. The monument displays the names of each man who mustered up that day and marched away from his Alabama home.
The monument having been placed at the actual historic spot from where those men left for the war, the Dragoons are now calling for a statewide registering of
opposition to this act of bigotry and insult to our Confederate veterans. They ask that you call each of the following members of the Autauga County School Board to say that, as a citizen of this state and descendant of a Confederate veteran, you are appalled and offended and greatly upset by their actions. If you have relatives in Autauga County i please mention that The Dragoons request that you be polite, but firm. \sk to speak with the these officers personally.

Texas, CSA
By Joyce Whitis
E-T Correspondent A cheering crowd of up to 300 gathered on the grounds of the Comanche County courthouse March 24 for the unveiling of a monument to Confederate veterans.
“We are here today to honor the men and boys who took up arms to defend their homes and their families,” said Thomas Harrison, commander. Sons of Confederate Veterans. “Our purpose is to remember our ancestors who fought for their country just as soldiers have done in every war. We ask only that our history and our heritage be taught to our children and remembered.” The gray granite monument is engraved
soldier, and on the taclcwitlia p^m^ltlias the gold seal of the Confederacy, the Texas flag and three of the Confederate flags, the 1st National, the Battle Flag, and the 3rd National etched in color on the front The base shows the dates, 1861 CSA 1865.
Music was by Texas Regimental Drum & Fife Corps. The 7th Texas Infantry gave' a rifle salute and four large cannons were on display, although not fired due to the surrounding buildings. Near the conclusion, a large Confederate flag was added below the flags of the United States and Texas and hoist to the top of the flag pole.	□

Making the “u.n.
Democracy subverted
By Olaf Childress The Waldheim Affair By Harold H. Tlttmann III Olin Frederick, Inc., $22.95
At 129 pages it’s kinda thin for the price, but one small hardback that's thick with the truth of why Kurt Waldheim got booted from his post as “u.n.” Secretary General -to make way for the more peecee Kofi.
The publisher's comment says it all: “The greatest contribution that the accusers could now make is to admit their mistake. This will serve the nation in a far greater way than their disservice. They have the opportunity to produce a profound event in American democracy which would set the highest example. Their accusations were unintentional. They believed they were right. By such an act they can call the nation's attention to the ultimate need for truth. This will also preserve the credibility of those who most remind the world of the promise of 'never again' since 'never again* has repeatedly happened.”
The publisher is being overly generous of course, for Tittmann's expose delivers a crushing blow to the credibility of Edgar M. Bronfman, whisky baron and president of the World Jewish Congress, along with that entire cabal of witch hunters having jumped into Austria's internal politics and then lacking grace enough to bow out Not even when famed Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal, himself no saint, tried to tell them they were all wrong would they hold off: Waldheim had been a mere lieutenant, and the documents proved him neither a Nazi nor a Jew persecutor, but rather, like
safe for hypocrisy
his father, one having defied the Anschluss.
Bronfman wasn't interested in such facts. What he had in mind were figures: as, his recent demands to the government of Switzerland, and no mean ones at that; the whisky king being on a roll. He wanted billions from this endless Holocaust payola.
Is El Dubya's new OSI an attempt to put another boondoggle, the Office of Special Investigations, down the memory hole? The original OSI spooks have slipped from the news, that OSI created by Jewish Congresswoman Elisabeth Holtzman to find and expel Nazis from the U.S. - the one which flubbed its mission, falsely accusing Frank Walus in 1977, John Demjanjuk in 1986 and Arthur Rudolph in 1983; first detaining them and then dropping charges without ever producing the evidence which should have been there before these men's names became unjustly tainted.
Dr. Kurt Waldheim, a man of impeccable virtue, was elected president of Austria in 1986 despite that country's voters being warned by the gathering empires of Europe and America to elect his socialist opponent Are you beginning to catch on? Well, that's only part of it The ADLs and WJCs, no less than their clients the NAACPs and OSIs, refuse ever to be satisfied or admit having made a mistake. They just keep on keeping on. Why? Because we haven’t got what Austria had: the fortitude to say. Butt out! The Office of Special Investigations still has Dr. Waldheim on a “Watch List” of undesirables. No proofs, it’s “classified Denied to see the “evidence” against him, although often asked for by the Austrian government and the former “u.n.” Secretary General, he may not reenter the “united” states. But why should he wish to?
Common sense for Sarah Brady
An armed man Is a citizen. An unarmed man is a subject. A gun in the hand is better than a cod on the phone. Smith & Wesson is the original point andcliclumertace. Gun control isn’t about guns, it's about control. (If guns cause crime, then pencils misspell words.) Free men do not ask permission to bear arms. If you don’t know your rights, you don’t have any. Those trading liberty for security have neither. Look in the U.S. Constitution © 1791: "All rights reserved ” So what part of “shall not be infringed” do you not grasp? The Second Amendment is there in case those other amendments are ignored. 64,999,987 firearm owners killed no one yesterday. Guns have only two enemies - rust and politicians.
Know guns, know peace and safety. No guns, no peace or safety. You don’t shoot to kill, you shoot to stay alive. What is 911? Government-sponsored “Dial a Prayer” Assault is a behavior, not a device. Criminals love gun control; it makes their job easier and safer. Only a government that is afraid of its citizens tries to control and disarm them. You have only those rights you're willing to fight for, so let's enforce the “gun control laws” already in place, not make more. When you take away the people's right to bear arms, you create slaves. The American Revolution would never have happened with “Gun Control” — no “government by the people, for the people...”
Gory, Gory Hallelujah!
America at War:
Any of you hot-to-trot warriors waving flags remember Napoleon 9s empire? Of course not Which is why we stretch our lines to the max.
By Nelson Waller
You and 1 were talking about the Third World War President Bush is bestowing upon us and the (in my opinion) slim chances that it can be justified in the context of America's whole history and track record, and the virtually nonexistent chance that it is going to accomplish anything worthwhile for us.
I was quite seriously enquiring who among you have young kinfolk or friends you are personally willing to see give their lives “serving” in “our” military in this conflict, and precisely what good you feel it’s going to do. Before you answer - I know you’re just about to pick up the phone! - let's consider the human legacy of our last two major adventures, Vietnam and Iraq.
Why do you suppose there’s a tear-drenched Vietnam memorial in Washington in the form of a huge black gash in the earth - the American Wailing Wall -but no equivalent for the Korean conflict? Undoubtedly because by the 1960s-70s the permanent regime in DC was that much more schizophrenic, that much more venal,
that much more divorced from America's! founding principles, that much more willing to waste American lives for the sheer hell of it. (I use this term in the biblical, not the profane sense.) Why do| you suppose there are tens of thousands of Viet vets who remain to this day seriously traumatized by their war experience? Wouldn’t you guess it’s because of the satanic nature of that conflict and the knowledge that they (more than any previous class of military) served as mere pawns in the game of globalist politics, money, and dope?
Who’s to say that this war is ultimately not for the sake of those gangster concerns as well? It so happens that what we call “Israel” is a worldwide nerve center for globalist politics, racketeering and dope.
Then there’s the 1990s Gulf War -excuse me, “Operation Desert Storm.” I’m honestly trying to piece together what it was we were trying to accomplish with that one, and don’t have a clue. But Gulf War Illness has proved devastating to thousands of young American lives as it has grown from a mere whisper among conspiracy nuts like me to a national “issue” - one about which the selectively hawkish media are understandably uncomfortable.
What will the stateside legacy of this latest war be - an immense new black gash in the earth, or a syndrome of incurable
ailments cruelly throwing thousands more service families on the sidelines of life? Or will it be the sight on TV of American soldiers' corpses being mutilated and dragged through the streets of another third-world capitol, as in Somalia?
Someone please do let us know which of your own descendants you are willing to see suffer catastrophic neural impairment or to be shown on TV in the fashion described above. All right, you're not willing see this happen. But tell us whether you honestly expect to be able to say it’s worth the price if this should be the future of that young person!
If you've been reading my stuff for even a short time you know that 1 am passionate about my country and its future - a full time patriot and staunch Bob Jones-educated fundamentalist Christian. 1 have no doubt many of you are shocked at my lack of enthusiasm for the Bush family's approach to national “defense.” But where is this really leading us?
As ever. I'm confident that you won't need to “shoot the messenger” here, because I'm doing nothing except saying out loud what everybody already knows but most people are loath to admit since it so little resembles what our peachers (sic) or favorite newscasters assert.

“Ifyou’re happy and you know it, dank your chains!” is one way to chide the peecees. And now, from Selma, Alabama, comes another.
By Patricia S. Godwin
There is no need to try to convince anyone about the “service of blacks” to the Confederacy, in any capacity. We do not need the black’s endorsement of the Confederate cause and validation of our heritage. God validated our heritage, and God is the reason our cause was right!
As I see ours “converting scalawags, carpetbaggers and closet Confederates,” the only thing that is going to open their eyes is the fact that constitutional rights are being blatantly denied. Not violated, denied!
The Confederate battle flag being taken from the public domain does not concern them. When the Feds come to get the good ole boys’ guns - that will concern them! I almost wish the gun legislation would get in full gear to give these good ole boys in their comfort zones a push!

Georgia’s Governor (a.k.a. King Roy) Barnes gets another flaggin ’. By David Meyers
Those of you who weren’t able to attend the King Roy Hospitality reception at the | Marriott Northwest on March 22 missed a great time. We had around twenty-five or thirty folks on hand between 5 - 7 pm on the sidewalk and right-of-way in front of the hotel, which really seemed to irritate the liberal Democrats attending that Jefferson- ( Jackson Day dinner where His Majesty was keynote speaker.
Democrat state representative candidate Aktar Siddiq (I’m sure that name will go over well on the ballots after 9/11), whom I recognized from seeing his picture in the paper two years ago, came out to me and in broken English tried to represent himself as hotel management, telling us we had to move. I responded that we were well aware of our legal rights, as we had cleared everything with the Cobb PD beforehand. He then went off in a huff and I later saw him outside the hotel doors waving his arms in the air at the police. I guess he was trying to talk them into making us vacate the premises.
Later the former chairman of the Cobb Democratic Party, Bill Waldrop, came over and talked to us. I was not impressed with him at all. He seemed like a real Goober, started talking about how great it was that we had the right to be out there protesting and “Ain’t America wonderful.” He let on that 01’ Roy would be along later and he just knew he wanted to see us. I retorted that we wanted to see him, too, real had He said we were welcome to come in to the dinner - if we had $75.00 (it being a
join us, too. In South Carolina they’ve seen the light: There is no compromise, only defeat! Look what they have on their hands now: another call for a statewide economic boycott, one that has even the state’s black merchants concerned. Hopefully, NAACP by this action is going to start the slow process of its self-destruction.
If you continue to feed the bear, he will keep on coming. Kill the bear and you’ve made your first and final statement. You see, the almighty dollar then starts talking our way! Most importantly, when we wake all Christians to the fact that Christianity is the primary and absolute target, when they remember that Madeline O'Hare did not go away, and accomplished her objective with the aid of the Christian community ignoring her, they'll see this was a mistake! Hopefully then we will have some real numbers in our alliance to fight this “inherent evil” being waged against us!
Please always keep this in your mind, regarding recent events since Jan 8, 2000. We showed the world in Columbia, South Carolina that the “Sleeping Lion” had awakened: and that was also our enemy's wake-up call! They saw they had to step up their cause to double-quick-time, because

fund-raiser). I let him know that all of us are going to work our posteriors off to force King Roy to abdicate this fall. We just caught a glimpse of Roy when he and his bodyguard drove in. I was told by others that he had a frown on his face when he saw us.
I want to thank all those who came out on Friday night and helped. The Colemans had come with their banner remembering, “ROY BARNES STOLE OUR FLAG, DON’T VOTE FOR THAT SCALAWAG.” Ken Waters was, as usual, highly effective andj entertaining on the bull horn. He really knows how to get folks attention with it. He was making so much noise that the hotel guests were coming out onto their balconies to see what was up. Some young tourists from Indiana who were staying at the hotel came out and got their pictures taken with us. Ken later asked them through the bull horn if they would be so kind as to take our governor back home with them on the bus because “Wp don’t want him.” There isn’t room to personally thank everyone who was there, but I really do appreciate it. Most all of them had Real Georgia flags or “Let Us Vote” signs.
I’d like to ask all of you who haven’t been out flagging King Roy yet to please help us. If we don’t get rid of him in November, any chance of ever getting our flag back is gone. If you are afraid of being seen in public at a protest, get over it. We are sticking our necks out, and would really appreciate an assist. If we succeed in helping rid Georgia of that tyrant come November, we can all bask in the glory of a sweet victory teaching the scalawags not to mess with Southern Heritage. □
our numbers are building. Never had they seen such a coming together at one event of our people! Complacency had set in among theirs, the “good life” having put them, too, in a “comfort zone.” So they had to have more controversy that would ignite their movement again.
Having seen the previously unpopular President JFK become Prince of Camelot once assassinated, MLK’s martyrdom was self-designed as the spark their cause needed back in the sixties. Never before had we heard such talk of Robert E. Lee and his Confederate company being traitors! Now slave reparations come into the big picture for all the “injustices and atrocities” committed against them! Racial slurs, in the workplace termed at “zero tolerance,” are justifiable cause for employee dismissal.

(Continued from page 1) our tag?” replied the Wizardess of Selma, Patricia Godwin. She answered herself: “Yes, I guess - in the sense that the 1951 legislature didn’t fathom someone wouldn’t feel proud to be from the heart of Dixie -they failed to specify the size of that logo and its location on the tag. They didn’t realize that, just 25 years later, the white legislators would be mollycoddling to a 25% black caucus... What they have done to the tag now is sleazy, even though it slid through on a technicality: that lack of defining, descriptive language in the act”
Wild Wyatt Willis of Prattville had this advice: “If you are scared, just go right above your tag and stick it on! Better yet, get you a battle flag on there and don’t worry about the small stuff. But call the Sheriff and see if he knows that you can put a battle flag on your Alabama tag. When he says you cannot, bet him SSO, then go get an SCV tag and win enough to pay for it!”
Battle flag waver Tim Meadows of Chunchula: “Send ’em to me. I don’t mind paying a few tickets.”
Fellow conspirator Cecil Williamson of Selma: “I believe someone in authority (need to get the source) told one of our group that the tag belonged to the person, and you could do it.”
That afternoon, Patricia Godwin had the answer: “Bob, John Reynolds of the Thomas Goode Jones SCV camp sent me a sticker today. It has a blue background with white heart on the left-hand side and reads in all caps: HEART OF DIXIE. He explains regarding the sticker’s legality, ‘The Motor Vehicle Division of the Revenue Department says all that is needed for the tag to be legal is that it display two stickers: month and year, current of course, and the numbers or letters; and that, by a 1951 Alabama Code, have Heart of Dixie (size not specified) on it I asked, if I did not like the stars fell on Alabama could I cover it with blue tape? and was assured. Of course!
1 then asked if I could cover it with blue tape reading Heart of Dixie, and was told. That might be better.
“So, Bob, go for it! Put the stickers on your cars/trucks, and give the rest to friends! Alan Parker told me today that, since the article ran in the Montgomery Agonizer, his phone has rung off the hook! He just had 1,000 more printed, and they’ve already sold 500! When and if a cop stops you, give him a sticker and say, ‘You have a Dixie Day, now, ya heah!* LOL!”
Charles Bodenheimer of Tallassee may have settled all doubts with this timely dispatch: “Section 40-12-265 - Mutilation or alteration of tags; replacement tags; use of improper tags.

And Glenn Benedict McConnell and Arthur “name a bridge for me” Ravenel were those two who lit the torch to “bring Dixie to the ground” at Columbia, SC in 2000! For that traitorous act, the contempt I hold in my heart toward them will surely send me straight to the fires of hell, but that is between me and my Lord.

Cecil Williamson: “We would not do this ‘for the purpose of deception,’ nor would we be using the stickers ‘in imitation of or substitution for.’ Let’s put them on and see what happens. I’ll help pay someone’s ticket to test the law*
Bob Bentley: “Thanks for the copies of those two laws referring to tags.

Reconstructing History
Egalitarians on a global plantation. By William J. Atkinson IV
A wise man once said, “Truth is the first casualty of war.**
The statement has been borne out over and over in the long history of this world's conflicts since man's creation.
Another truth no less accurate is that the winner of any war writes the account of it Perhaps at no other time in history has this statement been proven so well as in the War for Southern Independence, or what some incorrectly call the Civil War. In the last one hundred and thirty-seven years the history of that great conflict and the motives and principles of both sides have been reconstructed and changed almost as much as the South itself has been reconstructed.
Ask the average public school child, “What was the Civil War fought over?” and you will get a wide variety of answers starting with, “It was fought to free the black race from evil, intolerant, white men in the South who were running their own version of the holocaust using slaves," or the answer - “Was there a Civil War?"
The fact is that most modern public school children have no concept of American history, the founding fathers or the “Civil War." The ones that do learn “history" discover the founding fathers were immoral, drunken revolutionaries who didn't want a foreign king telling them what to do. This reconstructing of history is one of the more important aspects of the socialist agenda, because if true history is given to the people they may recognize that the modem concept of liberty is entirely different from that held by the Founding Fathers. The first target of reconstructionist history has undoubtedly been the War for Southern Independence.
Any serious historian who wants to find the true reasons behind the War for Southern independence must search beyond the modem textbooks and historical fiction that permeates our society today and read the histories and opinions of the men involved in that war on both sides. Only then does the truth about the motives of both sections become clear to a student of the War for Southern Independence.
The differences between the North and the South, morally and politically, in the 1850's were very striking. The South was becoming the epitome of constitutional philosophy. Liberty and historical Christianity pervaded the entire society. Strong families with Christian principles about liberty and government produced great statesmen such as John C. Calhoun and John Randolph, who championed the cause of freedom in the country. The North on the other hand was rapidly becoming a hotbed of radical socialists, religious heresies and abolitionist doctrines. The first communist philosopher, Robert Owen, came from the North. He founded the earliest communist experiment at New Harmony, Indiana in 1825, when Karl Marx was only a seven year old schoolboy.
Other communist settlements started during this time included Brook Farm, located in West Roxbury, Massachusetts, and the Fruitlands, started by communist philosopher Bronson AlcotL All of these ventures, as with every other communist experiment, ended in failure; but the ideas of communism were still taught by many. Various reforms championed by northern philosophers included health food cults, world peace movements, and the feminist movement
Another institution arising in the North was the public school movement Horace Mann, considered by many its founder, brought public schooling to die forefront of northern ideals by claiming that “nine tenths of the crimes in the penal code would become obsolete" if children were properly educated. Through the philosophies of Horace Mann, Robert Owen, and many others, the people of the North began to believe that salvation was a result of
education, not through the Bible and faith in Christ. The truth behind the purpose of public schools was stated many years later by Orestes Brownson, one of the founders of that movement. He said,
“The great object was to get rid of Christianity, and to convert our churches into halls of science. The plan was not to make open attacks on religion, although we might belabor the clergy and bring them into contempt where we could; but to establish a system of state - we said national - schools, from which all religion was to be excluded, in which nothing was to be taught but such knowledge as is verifiable by the senses, and to which all parents were to be compelled by law to send their children."
Abolitionism was perhaps the most alarming movement that sprang up in the North in the early nineteenth century. In the South and the North there were many Anti-slavery movements calling for gradual emancipation of slaves so as not to leave their owners in financial straits. Abolitionism, however, rejected this idea totally. It called for the immediate abolition of slavery, and when that did not happen encouraged slaves to revolt against their masters. It was during this time that the Nat Turner rebellion took place, in which several white families, men, women and children, were massacred by the slaves.
But the most damning of abolitionist beliefs was egalitarianism, or, that men are equal in all things. This teaching has its roots in the French Revolution and the Enlightenment period.
Historical Christianity had always held the belief that man was equal before the cross; that is, God was not a respecter of persons in terms of whom he would save, for all should have the right to a fair trial; but it rejected the idea that all men should be equal in terms of possessions, position and education. Christianity understood that God makes all men different, each with particular abilities and distinctions varying from others.
The egalitarian philosophy, however, demands public schools because all men must be equal in their level of education and thought; it demands communism, as all must have equal wealth; it demands welfare, because everybody should have a house, provisions and a job. And the only institution that could propagate these reforms, in the minds of egalitarians, was the government This anti-Christian and anti-biblical philosophy was the belief of most of the leaders of the North during this time, producing a hatred of the South and its belief in liberty rather than universal equality.
During this period of egalitarian thought, radicalism and socialistic reform up there, the South unlike the North had remained loyal to the historical concept of liberty. People in the South had refused to accept the religious heresies of Transcendentalism and Unitarianism, holding fast to the frith of their fathers. As a result of their Christian faith, they refused to allow governmental intrusion into charity, education and the distribution of wealth. Repeatedly the North attempted to bring up laws in Congress to create a public school system, and each time Southern legislators stopped it Staunchly refusing to condone the North’s attempts to create a large federal government, as a result the South made its existence a roadblock to that liberal Utopia the North desired to create.
It was not long before the Northern reformers realized that the only way to reach their socialist goals was to destroy the South. Wendall Phillips, a very prominent abolitionist, said: “I hold that the South is to be annihilated. I mean the intellectual, social, aristocratic South." Ralph Waldo Emerson, a celebrated transcendentalist and abolitionist, said, “If it takes ten years, and ten to recover the general prosperity, the destruction of South is worth so much." Thaddeus Stevens, a radical Congressman from Pennsylvania summed up the
Bashing Judge Moore isn’t normal
Miserable “gays99 are notfor laws.
By Lloyd A. Caperton
Last week, I proudly put my name on a petition which was being passed around to support Judge Roy S. Moore. As expected, the socialists and liberal writers are getting very agitated over his recent ruling to grant custody of children to a straight man instead of his ex-wife who is a lesbian. Moore was compared to the Nazis and to the Taliban because of his decision. So was Alabama, plus Christians and Southerners in general.
Many Alabamians are under the misguided belief that the United States is still a Christian nation. It is not, and has not been for a long time. 9-11 and the thousands of Southerners and others who began flying U.S. flags did not make it so. As predicted, 9-11 was used to strengthen the federal government and to remove more of our rights. Socialists consider that federal government to be the supreme power, not God! Anyone who believes differently is considered by them a threat. By comparing Judge Moore, Alabamians, Christians and Southerners to the Taliban, which they are bombing, one can't help but believe that they would not also like to be doing the same to us!
Some mentioned that being gay should not disqualify one from becoming a good parent. I wonder if they speak from personal experience, or just learned this in college? What causes so many people today to become gay? Some blame it on poor nutrition and lack of proper vitamins and minerals in modem diets, which can cause improper development when growing up. Others say it is a personal choice. Some say it is a combination of the two. Regardless
thoughts of many in 1861, stating, “If their whole country must be laid waste, and made a desert, in order to save this Union from destruction, so let it be. I would rather, sir, reduce them to a condition where their whole country is to be repeopled than perpetrate the destruction of this people through ouragency."
Notice that none of these men, all of them being dedicated abolitionists, cared about setting the slaves free; they were concerned with destroying the South. Thus, in 1860 when a radical administration took office in Washington, the South fearing the end of her liberties was in sight exercised its God-given and constitutional right, seceding from the Union it had voluntarily joined.
In 1775 the greatest manifesto in history was penned by the men of the Continental Congress, the Declaration of Independence. In that document these words were written: “When in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one People to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the Powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them..." Later on, the document maintains that, if a government becomes oppressive, “it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new government." Acting upon this great principle, the right of people to govern themselves, the South seceded from the Union. The biblical teaching, that liberty came from God, was not granted by governments, caused the men of the South to rise up and resist that invasion by the North with great courage, and bravery never equaled in history. In defense of these great truths, men from all walks of life in the South - rich and poor, small and great, white and black - joined together to fight the invaders. And it was because they were motivated by a desire to pass on the heritage of freedom to their children that they gave their lives on the field of battle.
As the superior industry and population of the North ground down the small but valiant South, boys as young as twelve and thirteen took their fathers* places in the ranks of the army in a desperate attempt
of the cause, homosexuality goes against all traditional religions with the possible exception of satanism. Even if you put religion aside, it still goes against the law of nature. But what would urban liberals know about nature?
One local writer brought up the Gaither murder in an attempt to prove his argument that Alabamians who didn’t approve of gays were potentially backward, brutal murderers. My sister covered that trial. His death might have had something to do with his agreement to pay closet homosexual Mullens, who ended up killing him, money to set him up with someone they could have a threesome with. I still have the court transcripts which were published. But, oh, I forgot! This writer wasn’t around then.
Let's change the subject and talk about some other well-known cases. Let’s bring up John Wayne Gacy, a man whose unnatural affection evolved into the murder of over 30 young boys. And how could we ever forget Jeffery Dommer, whose gay urges developed into murder and cannibalism? Those who think gays would make good parents have forgotten these.
A society cannot be both wicked and free. When a society becomes wicked, tyrants forge their chains. There is a higher power than the U.S. Supreme Court. Alabama is lucky to have a chief justice who recognises this. Only in a nation that has forgotten God would this not be appreciated. We must be willing to look evil in the eye and not blink. I will end this column with a verse from an old Confederate song, Maryland My Maryland “The despot’s heel is on thy shore, his torch is at thy temple door." Until next time, take care. Dixie Forever!

to preserve their right to self-rule. Finally, after four years of war during which atrocities never before heard of were perpetrated against the women and children of the South, the Confederate States of America and the South were destroyed.
Forty percent of the male population was wiped out in the South, along with countless numbers of women and children massacred by Northern armies. In 1866, less then a year after the war ended, the Northern government passed the Merril Act, setting up public schools in the South. All Southern children were required to attend. This act, along with the fourteenth amendment, completed the conquest of the South, and founded the monolithic federal government which today dominates even the minutest of our activities.
Along with the reconstruction of the South came the reconstruction of history. Northern historians quickly rewrote the War for Southern Independence into the version we all know so well today - that of the evil, racist, backward South trying to perpetually enslave the black race and destroy the Union in one blow, contrasted with the holy, pious, freedom-loving North saving the Union and freeing the slaves.
Indeed, anyone studying history will see that, far from freeing those slaves, the “Civil War" enslaved the entire country to a subsuming federal government which believes its laws and ordinances are greater than God and his word. It was this event, the destruction of the South, that started the irresistible and inevitable inarch toward absolute tyranny and the destruction of all biblical rights and freedoms, the fruition of which we are seeing today.
The reconstructing of history by the North has caused our present generation in the South to rise up and curse their fathers who died trying to keep them free. It is this constant changing, falsifying of historical facts, that brings Southerners to remove the banner their fathers fought under, and today embrace the tyranny the old South tried to resist. Thus, the once proud and free nation, wealthiest country on earth and the last bastion of freedom and Christianity - the South - is going the way of our liberties and rights: to the dust of history.	□

WE HAVE A CONSTITUTION?
The Elberta police department is proud to receive a citation from an agency of the state under the guise of improving public safety. Unconstitutional police roadblocks to enforce wearing seatbelts is harassment, intimidation, impeding the flow of traffic, endangering public safety and visually searching your vehicle without a warrant! Many of us have ancestors who fought in the Revolutionary War to free us from such tyrannical actions. The main tenet of that war was to gain our Creator-given rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Many of us have fought in wars in the last half century to keep these rights, only to realize that these rights are slowly being taken away by our own governments! Alabama Constitution: ART. I, SEC. 1. That all men are equally free and independent; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. ART. I, SEC. 35. That the sole object and only legitimate end of government is to protect the citizen In the enjoyment of life, liberty, and property, and when government assumes other functions it b usurpation and oppression. There is more to Article I of the constitution and that is why so many people with reprobate minds want to abolish it. Police departments need to get back to their main function as explained in ART.

All Dixie is sad and teary
As some heartbroke lass or lad Our hearts have grown mighty weary From Georgia scalawags.
YeehniUii. A most lovely day to flag a tyrant has come and gone. It was pretty hot out today and I’ve got a real red neck to prove it. Shotgun (@kp), a Ware County Southern lady, and I were the first on the front lines today in Fargo. Between the three of us, we had a grand display of flagwear flying from vehicles. And the “Yankee cavalry”? I believe their hearts cheered for our arrival.
Pulling right on into the dedication area
(booty kissing site), I was quickly surrounded by ’’Yankee infantry” (I think they was really Confederates acting as spies but had to play along). I asked where the public parking area would be. A logical question, being the public had been invited. A lot in back was pointed out but I was told no flags or protesting could be done “over here.”
I was then told of the “designated First Amendment area.” I ain't kidding. That’s what I was told. I inquired as to where that would be. “Other side of that hedge row”
I looked where he pointed and said, “we won't be able to see or hear him over there.” I’m sorry sir, that’s where you will have to go. I told him 1 understood his position.
That's where we set up. It was about 150 yards from the King’s makeshift throne room. Law enforcement at the dedication site was mostly DNR but we soon got welcomed to Fargo by Clinch’s badgewearing cavalry. They were all real gents and laid out their position and then pretty much thanked us from the bottom of their hearts.
Soon thereafter, reenforcements begin to arrive from other parts of South Georgia. Represented were the SPOFGA, SCV, LOS, and and and and and, the UDC!!I! Jack Lipthratt of the LOS, unhappy with our “designated First Amendment area,” laid down his flag and reconned the enemy stronghold.
He had several questions to ask because we were not there to protest the dedication, all we wanted to do was wave flags. They again told him “no flags over here,” so he then inquired about the ones flying near the makeshift throne room. “Would they be coming down?” Needless to say, he made new friends immediately and they followed him step for step the rest of his visit, “over there.**
Anyway, we were about twenty strong and as always got a good response from the public. And @kp gave what appeared to be the Guv one last play of the Dixie horn at the Homerville airport as we came home. I can't wait until the 28th to give Lyndscy Thomas, President of the Georgia Chamber of Commerce, a proper flaggin*. To be sure Gov. Barnes had the authority to say “Not” to a flag change, but the chamber has the money to make puppets say “Yes.”

INITIATIVE AND REFERENDUM:
Ballot initiatives keep democracy on track
By Jeff Jacoby
The Boot on Globe
When Winston Churchill suggested in 1945 that a referendum be held to decide whether to extend the all-party government that had led Britain during the war, Clement Attlee was appalled. Referendums, the Labor Party leader spat,' were an “instrument of Nazism and fascism.”
David Broder doesn’t go quite that far. But in a new book, “Democracy Derailed,” he makes it clear that he regards ballot initiatives - proposed laws that are submitted to a vote of the people - as a cancer on American democracy.
The initiative process, he writes, is “alien to the spirit of the Constitution.” It is a “favored tool of millionaires and interest groups.” It “threatens to challenge or even subvert the American system of government.” And that’s just on the first page.
Broder is of course a highly respected political journalist, and his book surveys the lively world of ballot campaigns with the careful reporting and amiable tone for which he is known. He reviews the history of initiatives, which grew out of the Progressive and Pojmlist movements around a century ago, and describes in some detail how the “initiative industry” operates today. It is fair to say he doesn’t like what he sees.
Ballot campaigns, Broder argues, undermine the republican form of government the founding fathers created. On a vast array of public issues, they bypass the very
officials who were elected to make public policy. “Indications” are, he frets, that initiatives can be deployed to hurt minorities. They are peddled to voters in “blitzes of distortion and half-truths.” Worst of all, the I initiative process allows powerful interests to simply buy the laws they want.
But is any of this really true?
Take the tidal wave of initiatives that| Broder says is flooding American ballots. “From 1976 through 1998, the average has been an astonishing 61 initiatives per [election] cycle,” he writes. In 1997-98J the number was 66. “It is a theme he has pressed in recent columns. “Everyone knows it rains a lot here,” he wrote from Oregon in April,
“but lately it has been raining ballot initiatives.”
Don’t reach for your umbrella just yet. On the legislative weather map, ballot issues amount to little more than scattered clouds. To begin with, initiatives aren't even allowed in 26 states. While that leaves 24 that do permit citizenlawmaking, 56 percent of all ballot activity has occurred in just five: California, Colorado, North Dakota, Arizona, and, yes, Oregon. And even in those states, initiatives generally fail. Most never make it to the ballot; of those that do, most usually go down to defeat.
Consider California, often thought of as a state in which ballot politics is running
amok. In the 89 years since California adopted the initiative process, 1,043 ballot measures have been submitted. Only 272 -26.1 percent - qualified for the ballot. Only 87 - 8.3 percent - actually became law.
In 1996, when the recent “flood” of initiatives crested, voters in the 24 initiative states considered a total of 102 proposed laws. Of those, 45 passed. “By contrast,” says Dane Waters, president of the Initiative and Referendum Institute in Washington, D.C., “the legislatures in those 24 suites adopted over 17,000 laws that same year.” Voters may think ill of state legislators, but they are not remotely close to displacing them as the dominant makers of law in America.
Sure, laws passed at the ballot box can be unfair. But for real cruelty and injustice, you need a legislature. (It wasn't ballot activists who segregated Southern drinking fountains.) And sure, campaigns for and against ballot initiatives sometimes resort to deceptive slogans and alarmist ads. The same can be said of every other type of campaign in American politics.
Broder's greatest concern is that special interests with deep pockets will hijack the initiative process for their own purposes, spending whatever it takes to change public policy as they see fit He writes, for example, about the “well-coordinated and richly financed effort” by three million-
MSure, laws passed at the ballot box can be unfair. But for real cruelty and injustice, you need a legislature."

OLD TIMES NOT FORGOTTEN II When war Criminal Sherman and his men came to New Manchester, Georgia, the women and children were herded up like cattle, the town looted and burned. Then our fellow countrymen, the Yankees (remember, we are all one big, happy country now), forced the women and children onto train cars and shipped them to enemy territory. The town never recovered, and passed from existence. Here is an account of it from the Louisville newspaper: “The train which arrived from Nashville last evening brought up from the South 249 women and children [from New Manchester] who were sent here by orders of General Sherman to be transferred north on the Ohio River. These people are mostly in a destitute condition, having no means to provide for themselves support.” These people were hired out to perform work at a price that was at no more than subsistence level, making them virtual white slaves of the Yankees. More than two thousand women and children were sent into the North in this manner. The papers in the area advertised them as if they were any other commodity for sale. Well, so much for the noble Yankee liberator. A war criminal is a war criminal, in a Nazi uniform or a blue Yankee uniform. They are the same to me. Anyway, at least now I know why I can’t find New Manchester, Georgia on any maps. The above info can be found in The South was Right, page 124.

aires - New York financier George Soros, Cleveland insurance executive Peter Lewis, and Phoenix businessman Joh Sperling - to legalize the medical use of marijuana. That effort met with spectacular success; of the five “medical marijuana*' initiatives on state ballots in 1998, five carried.
It would indeed be cause for worry if initiatives, which were bom of an effort to combat the political clout of the wealthy and well-connected, were now routinely exploited by rich insiders for their own purposes. But they aren't Political scientist Elisabeth Gerber, surveying 168 ballot campaigns in eight states, concluded that economic interest groups “are severely limited in their ability to pass new laws by initiative.” Only 31 percent of intiatives backed chiefly by special interests passed, while those put forward by broad-based citizen groups succeeded 50 percent of the time.
In California, the disadvantage is even more lopsided: Forty percent of all initiatives on the ballot in 1986-96 were adopted - but only 14 percent of initiatives promoted by wealthy interests. The pattern is the same in other states.
“Democracy derailed?” On the contrary, ballot measures keep democracy on track. Representative government is not always representative. When legislatures refuse to heed the voters, initiatives can set them straight.

It was with no thought of freeing the slaves of more than 300,000 slaveholders then in the Northern army..." “His Emancipation Proclamation was issued for a fourfold purpose and it was issued with fear and trepidation lest he should offend his Northern constituents.** He did it: “First: Because of an oath - that
if Lee should be driven from Maryland he would free the slaves..." “Second: The time of enlistment had expired for many men in the army and he hoped this would encourage their re-enlistment..." “Third: Trusting that Southern men would be forced to return home to protect their wives and children from Negro insurrection..." “Fourth: Above all he issued it to prevent foreign nations from recognizing the Confederacy." - http://www.frccflorida.org/

Terminal Phase
By Oiaf Childress
Thank God for leenaged hackers
la the 1990s the vast information age dawned. Computer enabled technology generated here introduced a period unlike any in history, reconfirming the inventive imagination and throbbing life force of a unique people's genius.
On the initial frontier it became obvious that governmental power in this phase had to be increased by whoever controlled the terminals. Albert Gore, President Clinton's equally inept veep (ludicrously naming himself “inventor'* of the internet), wished for that authority. But alert citizens, aided unknowingly (and indeed at first annoyed) by tecnaged hackers, eventually demanded and Installed software capable of stopping prankster viruses at the same time guarding against Big Brother's entering through the back door without knocking.
The internet was, of course, just another miracle; God apparently choosing to open our options further, the defining test being how we employ each awakening. With nothing new under the sun or beyond, this, too, wanting but to be perceived in its own day and then explained away by science, back at mid-century the boob-tube had in comparable manner been taken for granted as harmless entertainment, super-radio; even If that's not exactly what evolved.
The social order got disrupted. Families mesmerised by free television fare became addicted. C'onvernatUm loaf Its wft. turned to cliches: mimicry of whatever had taken up so many hours of attention. Amusement at last dived into mediocrity once half the houses sprouted antennas. TV's potential for shaping duties and opinions finally growing unmistakable by the time nearly ail of this populace was hooked. Suddenly, computer information processing appeared on a similar screen. ?
* And, if the earlier medium's incoming programs had so quickly plunged into the abynal, obviously a personal computer hookup for two-way communication lay yet further exposed to aahotagr, right when everything had started being detected and published about everybody.
Should the technology provide a more representative democracy for responsible citizens eventually voting or assigning all legislation by proxy, then accountability at Che doorway must 6c of greater import. The lords of propaganda having refined their art tor a century, deceit remained at the opening of our new era a deadly threat.
Time magazine, for instance, published this obviously specious poll just before the November 1994 elections: “If the election for Congress were today, would you vote for the Democratic or for the Republican candidate?** The returns. Democratic 40%, Republican 33%, were confuted a week later when an overwhelming Republican majority - having much earlier promised maauve reductions in government - took both the House and Senate, moat stales alao cqjoying huge Republican gains in every category. Check it out; that rigged poll is still in the archives.
But flickering television, phonier yet, remained in the early nineties elusive ae ever now you saw It, a message Indelibly printed In back of the mind, now Uk gone! And, with no means for an ordinary viewer to scrutinize what had jnrt darted across the coneciouanrse, if such television kingpins were to simply decide 90% of the people ought to approve (heir depraved politics, conjuring the same by terminal-controlling an actual finding of, say, three percent.
they might nip all initiatives for lower taxes in the bud; presupposing, of course, technopolitical stooges like AJ Gore being able to outsmart those tecnaged hackers.
That cunning saw myriad opportunities; and, from their viewpoint, the necessity for micro-processing capabilities of which the keyboard operator would be unaware The condition existed unavoidably, since we're talking alao about honest technicians, not just power brokers. The average citizen couldn't possibly grasp such complexity as the manufacturer had installed in that little box any more than a Silicon Valley expert might, like Arachne, foolishly compare his own cieativeness with the universal mind having connected so many unlikely threads with which to weave those wonders.
On booting up, initially every message coming in or going out could be captured without the operator's knowledge. Also, information processed offline might be filched upon reconnecting - from a secret file to which only the intruder had access. Safeguards must emerge if demanded, of count, for Stalin's law works both ways: Capitalists would sell the technology with which to rescue, along with the vigilantes keeping watch over such wily custodians, even themselves. Indeed, restraining the
thrilled with the speed and capabilities of their new computers. Discovering bow to travel this “information highway.** as the internet was first called, soon they learned how to import movies and computer games, take courses for college credits, join dating and pen-pal clubs, shop from thousands of specialty catalogs, maintain budget records and the like; all the while paying little heed to the peril of salivating demographers intercepting and tabulating every due aa to their interests, hobbies, cash flow, buying habits, net worth, tax bracket, family, friends, politics, religion and so forth.
Perhaps these would've been warier had they comprehended the methods employed by that cadre increasingly dominating New York and Washington politics. Dealing from complete dossiers on public officers and others who might be exploited, those insiders usually had a trump card at hand. Anytime an undoctond poll showed their bill for socialist legislation two voles dry of passage - knowing at all times who slept with whom, what promissory notes on past or figure campaign “contributions’* stood collectible and various intelligence about each lawmaker's investments, his closet skeletons and the like — never wasteful of information currency, they determined where and how much pressure to apply for exactly two votes. When appraising a pair of contending political candidates with no other determining factor, good press went to the move manipulablc aspirant always.
To those elitists, the computer user was a social unit, a pea to be tucked away neatly for his own good into some standard pod designed by the appropriate government expert The masses having proven resilient throughout the twentieth century, our Big Liar might start believing hb own words, never gi weeing there yet remained, as las standard TV leaser had it, “More to come?"
Indeed, by the late nineties the voter was getting so fed up with those self-appointed utopian planners conniving to manipulate his elected representatives that, seeing
what the government had lately become, how freedoms were compromised under this mutant state, the resister undertook to ventilate much of his concern online with like-minded others for effective action. In my own state, convincing key legislators the tide had turned, without receiving credit for such success from the weakening medlacracy, our Alabama Coalition in March 2002 stopped a frontal onslaught of potentially freedom-crushing bills cold. Not only did the Montgomery State House become inundated with email and phone calls; this alliance revived the minuteman idea, flashed word to every county anytime newspaper publisher and “Representative" Jack Venable's devious proposals came up in committee.
Apart from the brainwashed crowd and not sure how it would happen, only that a new vehicle had arrived, the believer meant with this internet to recover his lost heritage. Contacting like-minded patriots was the easy part; answering media snipes (bigots! racistsI homophobes I) a bit more formidable. And yet, once those New World orderlies had spent their cliches, the old wcbpresa/TV combo crouching under a withering verbal return fire - revisionists having begun teaching a dumbed-down
feckless name-calling against a growing movement whose time had come, and join the winning side.
But, to long as globalists drooling over open borders convinced most of the targets to cherish “safety" above freedom “for the duration** of their “war on terrorism” - and kept them in the dark about this looming showdown - then just how could the good guys win?
Great victories are never easy. Personal acts by those who did understand what was at stake had to challenge the pccccc line consistently, at every turn, reasserting first principles and moral values, informing the people, demanding democratic initiatives and referenda, holding rallies; ever ready on a minute's notice to forego the day's profit for whatever actions necessary in correcting communism's story of the hour until the liberal press gasped, “Anarchy!" At which time, online conservative news dispatcher! might pluck to safety all not loo petrified to leap as their dinosaur fell.
Conquer or yield. The endless frontier of this information age dawning was to be a twilight for those collectivist gods from the past, or of near term civilization. Two countervailing interests, as in every fray girding mainly for power, sensed also now the immense consequences at stake: the ruling empire to become stronger and more syitemized - or freedom's vigor renewed and matured in the legacy of our Founders.
A worldwide liberal media network was bound to attempt fortifying its entrenched position by occupying every vantage point from which micro-processed information might beat back this increasing awareness of global government power consolidation. With schemers like Albert Gore writing their initial order of battle, all traditions of western morality and the received wisdom of Anglo-Saxon culture started vanishing from public school textbooks. Parents not knowing what to do about it, the media next began harping for internet Alters that would “shield children from hale sites" while providing them access to “diversity.
love and multiculturalism. President Clinton*! “Goals 2000“ program had little to say about certain other goals understood among the insiders who put that creep in the White House: homosexuality, open borders and miscegenation.
In fact, the Bolshevik-Inspired penchant for renaming parks, streets and highways dedicated initially to heroes was exalting obscure nonentities - along with Lenin's American prot6g4cs.
From the first, however, “surfers" on these cyberspace waves were bound to come upon many censored truths some few had been rescuing for posterity. Thus, even as the medlacracy fervently coveted those controls, a hit-or-miss chance existed for reclaiming Alabama's heritage with the same software capabilities; identifying and sorting all facts needed to successfully combat every move the elite tyrants might contemplate. Patriots had to move quickly through the new openings: "MS Windows" of opportunity.
Manipulating electronic data, struggling to hang onto advertisers by posting online versions of fading glory, the medlacracy entertained visions of absolute, permanent power consolidation on the one hand, or fragmentation and loss of credibility on ihr other Bring traffic cops on the worldwide informnUiiti highway stood m that* V goal; simply reporting the movement there didn't appeal.
For the internet could protect mankind from tyranny or, under its manipulation, evolve as the perfect tabulator and director of our every move for a long time to come. Vice President AJ Gore wanted to be point man. Government had a plausible excuse for meddling, the system having entered into existence to administer that bonanza of federal contracts intruding everywhere. Free enterprise, always more circumspect, would've discovered it if tax-and*spendcrs (making do with whatever of ours they can grab each day) hadn't got there first.
Here was a great information exchange designed by many and occupying a natural position; what matter who took credit? As with the automobile and atom, it had come on time. But presumptuous Mr. Gore, with plans to detain and tax such freewheeling efficiency as Americans had made of “his" invention, suddenly a worldwide network outstripping the logistics of any dictator, could not allow that our side had already won, elitists such as himself lacking only to concede.
And yet, remember many a defeat has been snatched from the jaws of victory, French dictator Napoleon having put his finger on the key when enumerating the three points for winning - L'audacllil L'audaclU/ L'audaclU t Would we realize true representative democracy, or yield the Idea completely 7 The former as an act by the people, or the latter at the pleasure of our rulers?
No outsiders knew, and the alert could only guess, what plans were being laid at that secret Bilderberg conference atop the Burgenstock peak. But it had grown clear, ever since the election in spite of media cover-ups, that our sitting president was a draft-dodging, philandering, embezzling, lying pervert who had conspired with the enemy in Moscow, organized and taken pari in antiwar demonstrations at home and abroad; so it was reasonable to expect Clinton and (iore would be in the van of this race for total information comrui
