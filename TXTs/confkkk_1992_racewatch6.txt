Pulaski Rally A Huge Success
The Nashville Banner carried an article about the Jan. 11 White Pride Day rally in Pulaski, Term, saying that not as large a crowd was expected this year. When we arrived at the Community Center Hall hundreds of people were packed inside, people were standing in the aisle and back of the room with others unable to get in. It was a smashing success and the usual Reds who come down from Nashville to cause trouble didn’t bother to show up this year.
Great speakers came from throughout the nation, Thom Robb from Ark., Charles Lee from Texas, Stanley McCollum from Ala., Ed Novak from Chicago, Michael Lowe from Texas, Pastor Richard Butler from Idaho, Dr. Fields and others. It was truly a Patriots’ reunion. The speeches and the
march and rally at the courthouse were videotaped and advertised in this issue. This js a great tape and you will feel like - "you are there T
The march itself stretched out for nearly two blocks. Wfhen we arrived at the courthouse for Pastor Robb’s talk there were at least 500 people in the streets. Everyone was applauding and cheering as you can see for yourself on the video.

Fi H Trade Fandango
With each passing day President Bush becomes more defensive about his irrational free-trade policy.
Forced by presidential candidates Pat Buchanan and David Duke to acknowledge America first is the prime issue of the 1992 campaign, Bush has had to admit our economy is sick, very sick.
And the cause of the illness is the erosion of our once-migC^>agricul-ndustrial base brought j>n by the government’s obsession with internationalism and free trade.
In fact, our biggest export, so to speak, is jobs.
You don’t have to be an Ivy League economist to see what’s happening to America. (In fact, none of the professional economists can see what is happening at all.)
When plants close here, they open up in Mexico, the Far East, anywhere except in this country. Even our service industries are doing a lot of their work in low-wage countries and shipping it back here.
The clothing industry too has long been shipping material to other countries where it is assembled into apparel for the U.S. market.
General Motors, while announcing plant closings and firings here, is beefing up its Mexican operations. ripple effect
What happens as a consequence?
Besides the Americans who are immediately out of work, millions of others likewise lose their jobs. These are the people who work in the many supplier firms. Their employers lock their doors forever.
Then there are the local busi-rd ware stores, grocery stores, restaurants, you name it.
They must scale back and in many
Depression by all-out mobilization. The economy got going. The bankers profited—and still profit.
Then we had Korea and Vietnam. The economy appeared good, but inflation and corruption have since taken their toll.
BILLIONS OF SLAVES
The United States is the largest debtor nation in history, and there is no end in sight. The interest has to be paid, not only by us but by other nations who are in debt to the same bankers who have billions of slaves working to pay them tribute in the form of interest on money that was created by the banks out of nothing.

Eventually people either leave town or go on welfare—which today is being scaled back because of the loss of a tax base to keep that “industry” going at its outrageously costly level.
Well, you can finish the story.
You won't get the picture from the conservative pundits who. spout the internationalist line in the pages of Human Events and National Review. They want more free trade, more internationalism. And they say that given a chance their ideas would make the country all the greater. (More on this next week, when we show you just who these conservatives are who are backing this bankrupt policy, and their motivations.)
There is even talk of going back to war in the Middle East—talk of going after Iraq again. And the Establishment apparently has the polls to prove their point for war.
The classic solution for an ailing economy has been to get us involved in war. FDR ended the Great

Now is the time for people to pay attention.
The president is “listening” to the cries of the people but he is fighting them. The vice president listens but also believes a bigger dose of internationalism will cure our ailing economy.
Still the people demand solutions, not just insincere concern.
. And that’s why they are turning to populists like Buchanan and Duke.#
