Jefferson Davis: “The principle for which we contend is bound to reassert itself.

On June lf 2002, Mssrs. McGhee and Bazo met with 200patriots on the Alabama Capitol steps to recall the inauguration of OUR president Caution: this is banned knowledge.
By Ken McGhee and Jim Bazo
MONTGOMERY, Feb. 18, 1861 - The President-elect and Vice-President Stephens left from the Exchange Hotel in a procession at 12 noon in an open carriage lined with saffron and white and drawn by six magnificent white horses after having been met at 10 am by the Chief Marshal and aides representing the seven Confederate States which had formed the procession in front of the hotel. In the carriage escorting the President-elect, who sat in the rear seat next to Alexander Stephens, were, in the front seat. Rev. Manly, and, riding shotgun, Capt. George Jones, Captain of the military escort, the Columbus Guard.
All the governors from the seceding States were along, and marched as well behind the carriage - South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi and Alabama along with a host of dignitaries. Thomas R.R. Cobb, Howell Cobb and Barnwell Rhett (although somewhat chagrined, as he was wishing the Presidency) attended.
The Congress was already in the State Capitol Building, where they all signed the Constitution.
At the Capitol Building the Columbus
OWN, wmmring wed tunics and eky blue
trousers, effected close order Zouave drill prior to the inauguration and thrilled the crowd.
When the procession arrived at the State Capitol Building, the military units formed in a line along the street. Capt. Jones alighted from the carriage first, to clear a way for the President-elect and the others. Mr. Arnold’s brass band initially played a hastily arranged new tune called “Dixie,” and followed before the inauguration with a version of “Marseilles." Mr. Davis moved ahead of Rhett and the rest of the Congress welcoming committee. Rhett stood on the President-elect’s left, and offered his arm, while Chilton moved to his right. Flanked by congressmen, his arms linked in theirs, Davis started up the steps. Ellen Noyes stepped up and handed to Tom Watts the wreath of Japonicas, hyacinth and spring magnolias for the President-elect, and a large bouquet for little Aleck which she also had made that morning, and a bouquet for Stevens as well. With barely a stop, Rhett led Davis into the main lobby and up the stairs to the Congress chamber.

On a motion from Chilton, they stepped outside for the inauguration. Delegates formed in line, walked downstairs, and out onto the platform erected around the steps, and took their seats. One woman was present, the wife of former Senator Ben Fitzpatrick.
At last Davis stepped out, walking with Howell Cobb, Stevens and Rev. Manly behind. The militia fired a salute and President-elect Davis took his seat, Cobb seated on his left, Stevenson his right, with Captain Jones behind Stevens. Just prior to 1:00 pm. Manly delivered the invocation:

Let us celebrate our true heroes, not the ones approved by today’s mediacracy
This tabloid brings you hard-hitting facts the major media cannot talk about; their owners won’t let them. Don’t try to browse it in one sitting, nor discard without reading just because our patriotism isn’t the same as their ad hoc jingoism to bomb the world into saying “Uncle.”
We do join you in saluting such honorable forebears as George Washington, man of L peace who advised us to avoid foreign entanglements (but, boy, did he know how to fight when they came looking for it).
Ever notice the contradiction between how those New World orderlies agitate to keep our borders open for terrorists at the same time ranting for a war with every liny country which might have been 9-11 ’s staging area - while indications are that the plot got hatched right here in America? Strange? It’s downright queer! (We’ll talk on that, too.)
Well, then. Is this paper about racism, hate and such? Yep. We're all in a “race”

Let us celebrate! Rejoicing in the good life, basking on a summer evening in the abundance God has bestowed upon our land, it is well to recognize also a debt owed to Washington, Madison, |
Jefferson and Franklin as we rededicate ourselves toward preserving those rights they so courageously defended against tyrant King George.
Today’s tyranny is less open Yet, it’s downright insidious when people fear to speak their minds, or to think for themselves, waiting - to learn, instead, what’s “cool” on peecee teevee. We’ll discuss those latest TVQs (cues by perverts) in this issue, while begging you to be as big as the new, improved, “patriotic” media would have you think you are: don't trash us alternate papers without perusing.

“Great Spirit! Maker and Lord of all things, who made rulers tremble and senators become students. Thank you for the peaceful birth of this new Confederacy, for the unanimity of our councils, and for providing this man to go in and out before us, and to lead thy people. I pray that he might enjoy a sound mind in a sound body.
I ask for your blessing on this Congress sitting before him. Let the administration of this government be the reign of truth and peace. Put thy good Spirit into our whole people and turn the counsels of our enemies into foolishness. We ask all through Jesus Christ our Lord, Amen.”
At 1 minute to 1 PM Howell Cobb introduced President-elect Davis, and Davis arose “among a storm of applause.” Howell Cobb held the Bible for the swearing in ceremony; then Davit proceeded to give his address.
Gentlemen of the Congress of the Confederate States of America, Friends and Fellow-Citizens:
Called to the difficult and responsible station of Chief Executive of the Provisional Government which you have instituted, I approach the discharge of the duties assigned to me with an humble distrust of my abilities, but with a sustaining confidence in the wisdom of those who are to guide and aid me in the administration of public affairs, and an abiding faith in the virtue and patriotism of the people.
Looking forward to the speedy citah-
lishment of a permanent government to take the place of this, and which, by its greater moral and physical power, will be better able to combat with the many difficulties which arise from the conflicting interests of separate nations, I enter upon the duties of the office, to which I have been chosen, with the hope that the beginning of our career, as a Confederacy, may not be obstructed by hostile opposition to our enjoyment of the separate existence and independence which we have asserted, and. with the blessing of Providence, intend to maintain. Our present condition, achieved in a manner unprecedented in the History of nations, illustrates the American idea that governments rest upon the consent of the governed, and that it is the right of the people to alter or abolish governments whenever they become destructive of the ends for which they were established.
The declared purpose of the compact of union from which we have withdrawn, was “to establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare;" and when in the judgment of the sovereign States now composing this Conf ederacy, it had been perverted from the purposes for which it was ordained, and had ceased to answer the ends for which it was established, a peaceful appeal to the ballot-box, declared that so far as they were concerned, the government created by that compact should cease to exist. In this they merely asserted a right which the Declaration of Independence of 1776 had defined to be (See “Inaugural Address,” page 6)

— A different slant on the news —
HERE’S WHAT WAS IGNORED OR M1SREPORTED ELSEWHERE
Israelis sending foreign aid to Alabama
NEW YORK JEWS are much involved in this year's Alabama election. Five-term Democratic U.S. Rep. Earl Hilliard (D), of Birmingham, who refused to vote sanctions against Libya and Iran or to support Israel's actions against Palestinians, was forced into a runoff in the June 4 primary. Attorney Artur Davis, another black, raised triple the money Hilliard did in the primary's last 45-day reporting period, most of it from people in New York and pro-Israel PACs, after taking time off from his campaign to appear in Washington before the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC). Their new favorite took 56% of the runoff vote on June 25, retiring Earl Hilliard. How unusual, that Jews would spend all that money down here to curb a black man: one of the people they champion daily.
THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY, taken over by Jews in 1984, has since then reversed the wholesome, family-oriented atmosphere once its hallmark. Mr. Disney, who was rumored to “know the score** about Jews and apparently opposed them in private, must be turning in his grave knowing Jews took over his company. Typically when Jews take over an entertainment company in the West, the same features are visible to anyone paying attention: more muhkulturalism than previously, more feminism, more homosexuality, less emphasis on story lines and characters, less masculinity, more “flash,** less morality and above all more mention of Jews, e.g., Jewish names, bar mitzvahs, etc. Jews do all of that to water down the host culture, which makes America less cohesive, which makes Jews feel safer, since a Nazi-type/nationalist movement cannot exist easily in a multicultural society.
BACKBONE. The Rebel flag is flying again at the Eight Flags beach display in Gulfport, Mississippi. After a two-year hiatus, Harrison County supervisors voted 4-1 on May 28, “along racial lines,** reported the Sun Herald, “to put the Eight Flags beach display back up, but only underneath the eight American flags now flying at the monument at the foot of
DcBuys Road.** Why did it take backbone? Because Gulfport and Biloxi have been the scenes of some of the most appalling black invasions turned to lawless savagery and property destruction against locals, most of it unreported in the media as usual.
SWEDEN SWOONS for punishment The Swedish government is moving toward prohibiting Christians from voicing Biblical positions on issues. The Swedish Parliament is in the process of changing their constitution to forbid speaking out against homosexuality or any other “alternate lifestyle.** No doubt it will still be okay to revile us “redneck** “yahoos** who don*t get it Conviction for violating this malignancy if it spreads to a constitutional amendment could put one in jail for six months to four years.
SOMETHING’S O.K. IN DENMARK, but Sweden says that country *s “new policy for foreigners,** approved with backing from the anti-immigration Danish People’s Party, is rotten. Sweden's asylum applicants shot up 68 percent in the first three months of this year due to neighboring Denmark's impending crackdown. This law marks the latest in European efforts to clamp down on immigration, an issue that after September 11 catapulted to prominence throughout the European Union. Denmark’s reputation as a haven of liberalism and “multiculturalism** has ended. The law curtails asylum, slashes benefits for immigrants by up to 50 percent, ends automatic rights to bring in a spouse, and demands that foreigners pass tests in written and spoken Danish and Danish culture before they can acquire citizenship. Self-government begins at home.
GOVERNMENT BUTTS IN where wise men will not tread. Seems that some scramble and eat their nest eggs before they hatch, confounding George W., who dreams all should fly equally high. As mortgage lenders avoid unnecessary risks, El Dubya wants to intrude (Le., reach into our pockets) and move those poor into houses they can’t otherwise afford. Bankers don’t mind promoting President Dubya’s scheme once he
stacks this latest New Deal so that again they can’t lose (money-wise). To which end His Expediency announced on June 15 that “Son of New World Order** would furnish them the down payment multiculturalists haven’t the discipline to save up. In other words, it doesn’t matter how much you spend on your house in a good neighborhood, HUD is going to spend even more relocating black, brown and white trash next door!
PROTESTS PERMIT TO PROTEST. Seems that Huntsville has amended the First Amendment, and now says a permit is needed to exercise free speech. For 23 years the Rev. James Henderson served in the U.S. Army protecting the freedoms we supposedly enjoy, in Vietnam earning a Bronze Star for bravery under fire. But when he and a few others picketing June 13 outside a local abortionist's office were told to leave, police spokesman Wendell Johnson informed The Huntsville Times “He does have a right to free speech. He also has a right to obtain a copy of the city’s ordinance and fill out an application for a special events permit” The First Freedom joins that city’s newspaper in publishing Rev. Henderson’s police-aborted message: “Huntsville has more abortion clinics per capita than any city in the state, and now has as many as Birmingham.”
JUST WON’T GO AWAY. Citizens are free to guide their public servants in a sensible direction, and reps do respond to reasonable demands that history and its symbols be preserved. In our April issue we told how the Prattville Dragoons monument, placed at the exact spot from which its SCV list of troops had marched away, was removed by the Autauga County Board of Education to appease a few frothing-at-tbe-mouth “minorities.** Well, now that they’ve heard from both sides, it’ll be put back up - but, with a bronze plaque covering the small battle flag. Black “leaders’* hope to block that move. Rev. Johnny Davis of the Autauga Democratic Conference: “We’re waiting to hear back from the NAACP and ACLU to find out what we can do legally, or if they have the right to have it on public property.9*

Pom upsets Palestinians
Agence
France-Prcsse
PORN movies and programs in Hebrew were being broadcast by Israeli troops who had taken over three Palestinian television stations of Ramallah, irate residents of the besieged West Bank town told AFP.
The offices of three local television and radio stations were occupied by soldiers a few hours after tanks and hundreds of troops stormed the town in Israel’s biggest offensive against the Palestinian Authority and its leader Yasser Arafat
The soldiers started broadcasting the pom clips- considered extremely offensive by most Muslims - intermittently next afternoon from the Al-Watan, Ammwaj, and Al-Sharaq channels, the residents said.
“The pornographic movies started on Al-Watan television at around 3:30 PM,” one 34-year-old Palestinian mother named Reema told AFP.
“I have six children at home, they have nowhere to go with what is going on here and can’t even watch TV,** she said angrily.
“It’s not healthy really. I think the Israelis want to mess with our young men’s heads,” she said.
Anita, a 52-year-old mother of three children, complained about “the deliberate psychological damage caused by these broadcasts”.
“I am furious, these are the people who are shooting at us that also play this disgusting trick on us,” she said.
“We are desperate for news and constantly flipping channels and get these terrible pictures instead,” adding that videos of the intifada were also shown backwards with “ideal terrorism” written in red across the screen.
“Luckily, there is no electricity in half of Ramallah,” she said from her house in east Jerusalem where the channels are also available.
A fourth local station, whose premises were not seized by the army, ran a written message across its screen letting people know it was the Israelis who were behind the graphic scenes.
“Anything currently shown on Al-Watan and other local TV channels has nothing to do with Palestinian programs but is being broadcast by the Israeli occupation forces, we urge parents to take precautions,” the message said.
The Israeli military denied that it had anything to do with the pornographic programming and instead blamed the Palestinian leaders.
“The Israeli security forces have no interest in putting pornographic and racist movies on Palestinian television,” an army spokesman told AFP.
“The only reason we are in these buildings and in this city is to fight against terrorists and their infrastructure after giving the Palestinians various chances to it themselves,” he said. Palestinian leader Yasser “Arafat is willing to go low in order to make himself look better in this uncomfortable situation.”
Israeli foreign ministry spokesman Emmanuel Nachshon said any such broadcasting was “shameful,” but said he was not aware of the Israeli army’s involvement.
“I cannot believe that Israeli soldiers would engage in such despicable behaviour,” he said.
BUSING’S BACK, “Birdie Mae Davis,” too. That 1963 lawsuit, closed in 1997 when U.S. District Judge W. Brevard Hand ruled Mobile’s school system had met its fedguv “guidelines,” didn't stay blended into the multicultural melee Big Bro had in mind. Seems that races of men, birds and fishes, excepting for putative “leaders,” like to school with their own kind rather than report to the zookeeper’s portable cage. School board attorney Bob Campbell says plaintiffs’ attorney Michael McNair has no standing to reopen Birdie Mae Davis. “That’s a consent decree of a case that’s been dismissed,” explains Campbell.
SAM HOUSTON HIGH SCHOOL in San Antonio has a new peecec name. Previously the Cherokees, they are now the Hurricanes. Last year, Jonathan Hook, president of the American Indian Resource Center, asked school officials to stop using American Indian mascots. ’Scuse me? Since when has the very word “Cherokee” become offensive? Some groups seem bent on erasing every vestige of themselves and their culture from the public and it makes no sense. When was the last time you heard of a team called the “Fighting Fascists” or the “North Nowhere Nazis”? Never! Team names represent something the school admires and wants to emulate. The fact that Houston lived for many years with the Cherokee people makes that a perfectly suitable name, but it has been a long time since a hurricane struck San Antonio. - The Rebel Yell
DESPITE PARENTAL PROTESTS, thousands of emails begging them not to, the TV show Nickelodeon has gone ahead and aired “My Family Is Different,” a shamelessly pro-homosexual series aimed at luring children into the “GLAAD” (Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation) “lifestyle.” As sensible families unplug from this ever more abominable medium, others don’t seem to care. And the goatherds dumbing down their “kids” will be bleating how “glaad” they are about tha-at.
TIM MEADOWS, Confederate flag defender extraordinaire and Mobile County District 102 candidate for the Alabama House of Representatives, in spite of that character assassination campaign conducted against him by MAM (Mayor Mike Dow and Editor Mike Marshall), was still able to garner 31% of the vote in a first time run! This was against a firmly-entrenched 24-year incumbent having moved about as far left as a “representative” can get before falling into Lenin’s lap. They’re stalling on Tim’s trial date for the “crime” of flying a battle flag at the 2001 Veterans Day Parade, knowing his friends will gather again before the courthouse. See www.gulftel.com/homefree/49.htm for his story on the web.
FLAGGIN’ KING ROY. Georgia’s Governor Roy Barnes, having replaced his state's banner with a peecec cloth, sees the real flag anyplace he shows. Whether it’s a dozen workday demonstrators or scores on any weekend, wherever he wanders they are there - irate subjects who resent being called his constituents (look it up if you don’t get it; Georgians aren’t the dumb crackers mediacrats describe). Southern Party of Georgia spokesman Gary Ursrey: “These Hoggin’s are happening all over Georgia, from North Georgia and Atlanta to Fargo; St Simmons Island to Columbus, Cairo and Camilla to Augusta; the state is being covered by the citizens of Georgia to show Barnes we haven’t forgotten, and that we’ll ‘Remember in November.’ ”
PREPARATIONS. “A new Mobile Register-University of South Alabama survey shows that while 67 percent of black Alabamians favor the federal government making cash payments to slave descendants, only 5 percent of white Alabamians agree.” Will the 95% .of taxpayers polled who hung up on those “me-too” New World orderlies please contact The First Freedom for a free sample copy of coherent news and opinion?
“COMMUNIST SYMPATHIZER.” Mayor David Bradford of Muscle Shoals has pulled one of those “King Roy” boners. Putting up signs on both ends of Avalon which declare the street “Martin Luther King Memorial Drive,” he learns you don’t slide that old LBJ/MLK stuff by anymore without reprisals. Former supporter Loyd Fulmer in a letter to the local paper fumed: “In order to be politically correct you arc destroying our fine city, and your chance to be reelected. Did you know Martin Luther King was a Communist? David, you are a shame and a disgrace to our fine city! I want to make it official now; resign or take the King sign down. Enclosed you will find a brochure that I can get thousands more of anytime I need them; read it very good and you will find the truth, why the Veterans of Muscle Shoals will be so mad. Mayor, you could have made a fine elected official if you would’ve listened to the right people.”

July 2002 The First Freedom 3
Alabama demands an initiative and referendum amendment with teeth
Twenty-six states have Initiative and Referendum (IAR) laws. Let's require all candidates between now and November to declare for ours.
By Anne Winston As you are aware, an I&R provision is contained in the Alabama Code, establishing guidelines for using citizen petition at the local level. However, a state I&R could probably be passed, without going through the legislature, if voters across Alabama passed identical state I&R bills at the local level.
At any rate, having local I&R already in the code erases any objections that legislators might have as to its constitutionality at the state level.
Of course, as gatekeeper of the state ballot, the Secretary of State could settle this matter once and for all ... by simply placing the question of a state I&R procedure on the ballot
To justify doing this, he probably would need to be presented a citizen petition that instructed him to do it, since no signature requirements have been established for placing issues on the state ballot. There is ample precedent for doing such a thing, dating back to the days when the states discovered there were no provisions in their constitutions for amendment; at that time, they took super-legal actions, that is, creating the procedures as they went.
Alabama Secretary of State Jim Bennett is quite aware of this argument and, believe it or not, concurs. Although, he is skittish about the legal ramifications.
Another approach is to sue each state official who knowingly blocks ... through purposeful inaction ... the people's First Amendment right of petition.
Here is the I&R text in the Alabama Code:
Section 11-44-105
Adoption of ordinances by initiative and referendum.
Whenever an application shall be presented to the board of commissioners purporting to be signed by the electors of the city or town then duly qualified to vote in the city or town equal in number to at least 25 percent of the entire number of voters who were duly qualified to vote in the last general municipal election held in said city or town for the purpose of electing a commissioner, requesting that a certain ordinance, and setting out the provisions thereof, be enacted into law by the board of commissioners of said city or town, it shall then be the duty of said board of commissioners to forthwith examine into the qualifications of the signers of said petition; and, if it shall find that said petition does not contain 25 percent in number of the entire number of voters who were duly qualified to vote in the last general municipal election for the purpose of electing a commissioner, it shall within 10 days after the receipt of such petition notify the persons presenting the same in writing of such fact, provided their names and addresses shall have been endorsed on said petition as the presen tors of said petition, said presentors not to exceed 10, and thereupon the persons so presenting the said petition shall have 10 days within which to secure additional signers to meet the deficiency pointed out by the said board of commissioners. In case of failure to secure any additional numbers that may be necessary within 10 days, no further action shall be taken upon said petition by the said board of commissioners.
If the said petition as originally presented is found by said board of commissioners of said city or town to contain the signatures of electors of the city or town then duly qualified to vote in the city or town equal in number to at least 25 percent of the entire number of voters who were duly qualified to vote in the last general municipal election held in the said city or town for the purpose of electing a commissioner, or if additional names shall have been secured thereto as hereinabove provided to bring the total number of signatures of such voters up to said 25 percent and said petitions conform to the other requirements of this article, then the said board of commissioners of said city or town shall within 30 days after receipt of said petition consider the said proposed ordinance. If it fails or refuses to enact said ordinance into law within said 30 days after the receipt of said petition, it shall then be the duty of said board of commissioners to submit to a vote of the electors of said city or town, either at a general election for commissioner of said city or town or a special municipal election, such election in any case to be not less than 60 days nor more than 70 days from the date of the filing of said petition, the question of whether or not said ordinance shall become law. Notice of such election shall be given by publication once a week for three successive weeks in some newspaper, if any, published in said city or town and, if there is no such newspaper, then by posting notice of said election at five public places in said city or town at least 20 days before the date fixed for said election, and such election shall be held and the result declared in all respects the same as a general election for a commissioner of
said city or town.
At such election, the ballots shall be substantially in the following form: “Official Ballot (Then shall follow a brief statement of the substance of said proposed ordinance). ( ) For said ordinance.
() Against said ordinance.** Those in favor of the enactment of said ordinance into law shall so indicate by placing a cross mark within the brackets before the words “For said ordinance" and those who are opposed to the enactment of said ordinance into law shall so indicate by placing a cross mark within the brackets before the words “Against said ordinance." A separate ballot shall be prepared and used for each proposed ordinance. Should a majority of the votes cast in said election be in favor of enactment into law of said proposed ordinance, then said ordinance shall become operative three days after the result of said election shall have been declared, but should a majority of the votes cast in said election be against said ordinance, then said proposed ordinance shall not become law by reason of said procedure.
(Acts 1915, No. 749, p. 869; Code 1940, T. 37, &sect;119.)

Top idiots of2001 awarded signs to wear; all of them allowed to vote
These badges help identify the uexceptionaland those seeking reparations for9 uh, something...
■	Idiot # 1. I’m a medical student currently doing rotation in toxicology at the poison control center. Today, this woman called in very upset because she caught her little daughter eating ants. I quickly reassured her that the ants are not harmful and there would be no need to bring her daughter into the hospital. She calmed down and, at the end of the conversation, happened to mention that she gave her daughter some ant poison to eat in order to kill the ants. I told her that she better bring her daughter into the Emergency Room right away. Here's your sign, lady. Wear it with pride.
■	Idiot # 2. Seems that a year ago, some Boeing employees on the airfield decided to steal a life raft from one of the 747s. They were successful in getting it out of the plane and home. Taking it for a float on the river, they were surprised by a Coast Guard helicopter coming toward them. It turned out that the chopper was homing in on the emergency locator beacon that activated when the rafr was inflated. They are no longer employed at Boeing. Here's your sign, guys. Don’t get it wet, the paint might run.
■	Idiot U 3. A man wanting to rob a Bank of America branch office in downtown San Francisco walked into the branch and wrote, “This iz a stikkup. Put all your muny in this bag." While standing in line, waiting to give his note to the teller, he began to worry that someone had seen him write the note and might call the police before he reached the teller's window. So he left the Bank of America and crossed the street to Wells Fargo. After waiting a few minutes in line, he handed his note to the Wells Fargo teller. She read it and, surmising from his spelling errors that he wasn’t the brightest light in the harbor, told him she couldn’t accept his stickup note because it was written on a Bank of America deposit slip, and that he would either have to fill out a Wells Fargo deposit slip or go back to Bank of America.
Looking somewhat defeated, the man said, “Okay,** and left. He was arrested a few minutes later while waiting in line back at the Bank of America. Don't bother with this guy's sign. He probably couldn't read it, anyway.
■	Idiot # 4. A motorist, unknowingly caught in an automated speed trap that measured his speed using radar and having photographed his car, later received in the mail a ticket for $40 and a photo of his | car. Instead of payment, he sent the police department a photograph of $40. Several days later he received a letter from the police along with a picture ofj handcuffs. He immediately mailed in his $40.
Another sign!
(Though this guy might be onto something worth thinking about.)
■	Idiot H 5. This guy walked into a little comer store with a shotgun and demanded all the cash from the cash drawer. After the cashier put the cash in a bag, the robber saw a bottle of scotch behind the counter on the shelf that he wanted. He told the cashier to put it in the bag as well, but the cashier refused and said, “Because I don’t believe you are over 21." The robber said he was, but the clerk still refused to give it to him because he didn’t believe him. At this point the robber took his driver's license out of his wallet and gave it to the clerk. The clerk looked it over and agreed that the man was in fact over 21 and he put the scotch in the bag. The robber then ran from the store with his loot The cashier promptly called the police and gave the name and address of the robber that he got off the license. They arrested the robber two hours later. (Remind me to have more signs printed up. Give this guy his!)
■	Idiot # 6. A pair of Michigan robbers entered a record shop nervously waving revolvers. The first one shouted, “Nobody
move!" When his partner moved, the startled first bandit shot him. (This guy doesn't need a sign, he probably figured it out himself.)
■ Idiot # 7. Arkansas: Seems this guy wanted some beer pretty badly. He decided he'd just throw a cinder block through a liquor store window, grab some booze, and run. So he lifted the cinder block and heaved it over his head at the window. The cinder block bounced back and hit the would-be thief on the head, knocking him unconscious. Seems the liquor store
window was made of plexiglass. Toe whole event was caught on videotape. (Oh. that smarts. Give him his sign!)
■ Idiot # 8. Ann Arbor The Ann Arbor News crime column reported that a man walked into a Burger King in Ypsilanti, Michigan at 12:50 am, flashed a gun and demanded cash. The clerk turned him down because he said he couldn't open the cash register without a food order. When the man ordered onion rings, the clerk said they weren’t available for breakfast. The man, frustrated, walked away.
It’s Heart of Dixie despite Holmes
By Olaf Childress
“Heartless" Alvin Holmes, the Alabama “representative" who, by trickery, was their instrument in getting our official auto tag motto reduced to 1/16" high letters inside a less than Vi heart this year is deluded to imagine his inflammatory talk can keep the multicultural choo-choo puffing along on time here. Your sponsors may control the major TV networks, movies and publishing, Mr. Holmes, but not the internet. There is where we ventilate those truths the liberal media can no longer censor. There, and in tabloids like The First Freedom.
So, sir, if you should see the light, and realize a diasporadic race which refuses to assimilate anywhere but seeks to control the media everywhere has been using you, see page 8, order your “Heart of Dixie" decal and stick it over that “stars fell on" inanity. Look, we understand your problem. As an American whose ancestors were brought aboard Boston clippers under the Stars and Stripes and sold as slaves, you have a right to believe that those same Zionists having started the Bolshevik Revolution sincerely desire all men to share “equally" in their ill-gotten wealth and power. You also have a right |o consider the following truths.
There are differences between the races of mankind. Okay, you knew that - it just wasn’t smart to challenge the media line.
There are differences between the South and North. Many of your people migrated up there when the Big Lie grew rampant.
But where did they migrate back to?
There are differences between Africa and Alabama. The mediacracy has, since colonialism ended on that dark continent, beef) rewriting history to show civilization originating there rather than in Europe. Can you recall which parts of Africa gave us government by laws and not men, the printing press, the steam engine?
I know this sounds preachy, sir, it’s the kind of “racism" your sponsors are all but desperately trying to censor, but they will not succeed. Along with the civilization Whites alone in this world have nurtured, a culture most other races greatly envy, we mean to keep such ingenuity as is ours. No doubt you'll continue to be a pawn of the Zionists, but I would be remiss not to warn you the tide is turning.
To put it bluntly, “Rep." Holmes: since the word “Dixie" offends, that being simply the name of the place where you live and draw your government paycheck, would you prefer migrating to some “People's Republic" of multicultural egalitarianism? Africa, maybe?

Millions divvied up by secret city cabal (no charges; they’re black)
M MS “String °f	disclosure of 0* Virginia Beach m	 I-------
arts, Mayor Dow’s construction a8«nent can be adjudged by some of
pearls, ,nUyur uow s construction mania finds ever fewer taxpayers out and about wearing them.
By Nick Jongebloed
Mobile’s oigy of high-profile, publicly funded projects is the weak link in that “string of pearls.” What’s missing in this mess is any rational, much less balanced, debate on whether such shows demonstrate positive effects, to say nothing of those pie-in-the-sky results supporters routinely claim.
There has been a great deal of concern regarding the city of Mobile and its future as a convention and visitor destination, heightened by the abrupt departure of the president of the Mobile Convention and Visitors Corporation, a private, nonprofit agency, following on the departure several
months ago of the executive vice president
Little is known of these moves.
The Mobile Register, attempting to get certain information on compensation for officers of the MCVC, found it necessary to use extraordinary efforts via federal
man-
adjudged by some of the following data published on their website.
•	Over 3 million overnight visitors.
•	Annual visitor spending: $647.9 million.
•	Virginia Beach tourism had a $1.3 billion economic impact on the region.
•	Our tourism industry provided 10,251 jobs within the City, plus 5,126 regionally. Visitor expenditures generated $53.3 million in direct City revenue.
•	For every dollar spent on tourism, we earned $1.65 in return.
•	Nearly nine out of ten visitors plan to visit us again within two years.
Mobile has in the recent past paid for many studies regarding major projects and their economic impacts on the city. At times these takeoffs, developed by firms specializing in such projects, seem endless. They forecast a positive market analysis, justify more expansion and support those politicians wishing to tax and spend for convention centers, ball parks and sports arenas.
Mobile, like many cities across the country, looks for that single pot of gold that will put the city into better economic times. But this strategy only imitates what those others are doing, all expanding for the same market. While chasing white elephants along the waterfror^ from cruise ships to container ships to more and more interstate highway and bridge systems, vital needs — beginning with infrastructure repairs and paved streets full of numerous
potholes — go unmet. Safe neighborhoods that are clean, affordable, interesting and eclectic attract entrepreneurially minded people, along with good and secure schools.
Another Southern city that Mobile wishes to compete with is Savannah, Ga. (www.savcvb.com), which has enjoyed a council-manger form of government since 1954, during which period ours has done little or nothing to maintain its natural beauty. There, however, the word is, “Welcome to Savannah, the sultry and mysterious 1 Belle’ of the Southeastern coast. Savannah captivates the suitors that come to call with her natural beauty, eccentric charm and traditional Southern Hospitality - because Savannah is genteel, gracious and captivating. Savannah is the beautifully preserved hidden treasure of the Low Country. Come unlock the history, romance and beauty that lies within. Explore every nook and cranny, because you are her guest and Savannah loves sharing her treasures with you.” Mobile’s immediate needs are for new, mixed-income housing developments to replace the rundown and crime-plagued housing projects that generate a high level of fear and anxiety in our downtown areas. People just shun such places. An example of this avoidance was made obvious to me recently when our Retired Officers Association took a two hour dinner cruise aboard the paddlewheel boat operating at Mobile River. On a beautiful Friday evening, the convention center was completely empty; Cooper park, south of there, occupied by
laws covering tax exempt corporations in order to learn that those two top executives received salaries and benefits of $253,000 annually.
This secrecy is not uncommon within the city of Mobile’s political leadership, with its mayor-council form of government further complicated by a racial divide and a supermajority requirement for passage of
MiliSaiiMjif AHC Meets, Announces Plans for Wheeler Plantation
two elderly black gentlemen and their pet cats. Not another soul in this magnificent waterfront park on a weekend evening unless you counted the bronze sculpture of Mr. Cooper sitting on his iron bench!
Now, I ask the reader: how does Mobile stack up, with its “clandestine” MCVC whose leadership spouts, “we are not part of the city”? That much is correct. Their exorbitantly paid top executives produce little in return for the two million plus dollars the agency receives annually from this city. And it doesn’t stop with the MCVC. As 1 write this, it is announced that “we” have hired yet another consultant for a 27 page report costing $12,000, to determine how Mobile could make some money from its ongoing waterfront construction and multimillion dollar investment in a cruise ship facility. Naturally, one of the recommendations is to create yet another government agency or department to “manage” the operation. If Mobile’s citizens ever elect the council-manager form of government, the city manager - working with a team of like professionals who help deliver the services every city needs - would be the one who, if it were advisable, hire a manager to oversee the city docks operation.
Mobile’s citizens need to change their government to a professional manager who will bring proven commitment, maintain public trust and confidence, achieve equity and social justice, and affirm human dignity by improving the quality of life for all residents.
Only recently did City Council President Reggie Copeland discover tens of milIions[ in federal Community Development Block Grants having been distributed by a secret committee comprised of the three black council members, going back as far as J 9&5. Fortunately. with the recent election of three new members to the council, this type chicanery might end. But another look roust be taken at that “downtown will save us” attitude espoused by the Chamber of Commerce. One usually thinks that the business community would be praising the virtues of unfettered free enterprise, but here anything “the government” pays for is a go. Such approaches are both ineffective and, in the long run, wasteful.
By the advent of the internet, progressive cities with the council-manager form of government (www.icma.org) developed web sites which report vast amounts of information to their citizens. 1 will list several examples, most of them cited over the past years by Mobile’s mayor and council as places they wish to emulate.
One that 1 found most progressive, and which, unlike MCVC, considers itself a vital part of its city, is the Virginia Beach Convention and Visitor’s Bureau. (www.vbgov.com./dept/cvd/). Contrast Virginia Beach, with its council-manager form of government for over 50 years, with Mobile and the reported comments of our acting MCVC president and board chairman Mr. Jimmy Bledsoe: “We are not part of the city.” He explained that the late Arthur Outlaw did not want the convention business affected by local politics. This could be due to the past criminal activity of Mobile Commission members in dealing with convention and visitor business.
What follows is an excerpt from the Virginia Beach Website:
“The mission of the Department of Convention and Visitor Development (CVD) is to facilitate the creation and enhancement of convention, tourism, special events programs and resort related improvements in order to maximize tax revenues. The Department focuses on Virginia Beach as a Convention and Tourist destination which appeals to diverse markets and generates a high return on its tourist advertising investment, which in turn supports high quality local government services and programs enjoyed by our citizens.”

Cradle of the Confederacy: wily Warner would wink at a 'reinterpretation * of our capitoL
By Jane Doughty
The Alabama Historical Commission (AHC) is designated by the Code of AL Section 31-9-261 as the agency responsible for restoration and preservation of the state Capitol of Alabama and its contiguous historic grounds, which is recognized by the United States government as a National Historic Landmark. Further, the AHC is instructed to protect the historic and architectural integrity of this grand Greek revival masterpiece that served as the first Capitol of the Confederacy in 1861. The AHC is made up of 20 non-paid commissioners who represent the people of Alabama, having been nominated by various colleges and other entities, or are certain designated officers of Alabama government. The AHC management consists of numerous state employees including executive director Lee Warner.
The AHC held a regular quarterly meeting on Friday, May 24 at 10 AM in Huntsville. One agenda item was a report by historic sites director Mark Driscoll. Concerning the Confederate Monument restoration, he mentioned that AHC would “do a bid” in late fall 2002. No details were given and he made no statement on the Capitol Grounds Project Last year, director Warner had said that these two projects were funded by totally separate sources. Then, in February 2002, Warner indicated that these two projects were in some way connected. That is, when the governor told him to put the Grounds Project on hold, Warner concluded that meant to hold up on the Confederate Monument restoration work as well and said that both projects are “in hiatus.” The question now becomes, if AHC will “do a tid” on the Monument, will it also “do a bid” on the Capitol Grounds Project? Interested Alabamians need to know!
AHC Commissioner Mike Mahan, who also serves on the AHC Properties
Committee, questioned following that May 24th Huntsville meeting could not or wouldn’t give information as to whether plans for the Capitol Grounds Project are finished. He also doesn’t know if AHC is in possession of those plans in the AHC office at South Perry Street in Montgomery. It is surprising that Commissioner Mahan wouldn’t have this information since he is a 26-year member of the AHC and, repeat, a member of the AHC Properties Committee.
It appears from available AHC Financial Reports that between $250,000 and $440,966 has been paid or is obligated to be paid for the architectural plans on the Capitol Grounds Landscape Design. If this is correct, citizens should be allowed to know the status of these Plans and, if completed, to view them. The contract for plan design is with Giattina Fisher Aycock Architects, Inc. of Birmingham and is paid out of state funds.
Following the May 24th meeting, a one-hour special presentation was given on the Alabama historic property known as the General Joe Wheeler home. Notable comments about the property included: first, change of the name by AHC from the Wheeler Plantation to Pond Spring; and second, the announced intention of the AHC Properties division to alter the focus from General Joe Wheeler to viewing the property from the perspective of his
Carmack’s Pledge To The South
(Thanks to Jim Sewell)
“The South is a land that has known sorrows; it is a land that has broken the ashen crust and moistened it with tears; a land scarred and riven by the plowshare of war and billowed with the graves of her dead; but a land of legend, a land of song, a land of hallowed and heroic memories.
“To that land every drop of my blood, every fiber of my being, every pulsation of my heart, is consecrated forever.
“I was bom of her womb; I was nurtured at her breast; and when my last hour shall come, I pray God that 1 may be pillowed upon her bosom and rocked to sleep within her tender and encircling arms.”
-Edward Ward Carmack, Congressman 1897 - 1901, 10th Tennessee District. (Pledge spoken from the floor of the House of Representatives.) □
daughter, Annie. The AHC claims to have determined that the 1930’s Annie Wheeler era best “facilitates” AHC current restoration efforts. The New South Associates, & Atlanta firm, is employed by AHC to search for linkage to the other periods and cultures which will be emphasized at the General Wheeler home. The cost for Pond Spring's complete restoration and “interpretive development” is estimated by AHC at $7 million.
General Joe Wheeler, recognized as one of the most outstanding cavalrymen of the War Between the States, at age 26 was one of the youngest Confederate Generals. He commanded 127 battles and participated, in over 500 skirmishes. After the war, he became a distinguished Alabama attorney and served several terms in the U. S. Congress. He later served as Major General during the Spanish American War.
Without question. General Wheeler is the most important and distinguished person known to reside on the property where he built his home, raised his family, and lived until his death in 1906. He is the well-known and loved person who is now being “interpreted” as just one among many who may have passed over this property known for many, many years as the Wheeler Plantation.
For your comments or questions, the Alabama Historical Commission may be reached at email addresses found on www.preserveala.org (view the AHC Calendar here), or call the Montgomery office (334) 242-3184. Concerned citizens are encouraged to learn more about plans tor these and other Alabama Historic Properties by attending the next AHC quarterly meeting which has been announced for Wednesday, August 7th, at 10:00 AM in Tuscaloosa._____________________________0

NAACP gives black people a black eye
When a majority of Whites and half the Blacks voted to keep their Mississippi flag, that was enough democracy for Mfumi A Company.
By James Lee Weaver
Black people in the United States of America have it better than their counterparts anywhere else in the world but it is far from a Black Utopia. Such a place as for which they pine has not, does not and will not ever exist. Nor will it for any ethnicity in a “Melting Pot” of “multiculturalism.” Black Americans face many serious problems, as does every other ethnicity in this gfeat nation. International terrorism. Black on Black crime, educational opportunities, economic opportunities, poverty, HIV/AIDS, Sickle Cell Anemia, abandonment of the primary religion that made this country great and broken homes are but a few of the more serious problems that leaders of all historically Black organizations should be working on. The NAACP was well intentioned in its early days and, by concentrating efforts on current problems, accomplished many significant advances for Colored People (see www.naacp.org/ past future/naacptimeline.shtml). Times have changed, however, and the NAACP’s major efforts, in spite of all the problems facing Blacks, seem to be concentrated on the eradication of all things “Southern.” Their rallying cry has changed from “equality” to “hate.” “Hate crime” reporting fills the airways of radio and television stations everywhere. Every newspaper is filled with articles and pictures of “hate crimes.” All this effort seems to be for the purpose of building stronger support for the “reparations movement” This activity violates all the NAACP was created to do. The following, taken from their home page, seems to be in direct conflict with their current philosophy: “The NAACP sponsors a variety of programs to make real the promise of America. Our programs are designed to ensure civil rights compliance, equitable treatment of all Americans under law, the attainment of educational excellence, access to health care and economic empowerment. Our political empowerment initiative is devoted to that most fundamental right of all Americans, fully participatory democracy.”
The last line of that mission statement describes the NAACP’s dedication to “fully participatory democracy.” Yet, in a statement issued by their president after the democratic process had ruled in Mississippi, he declared the results to be unacceptable to the NAACP: “Kweisi Mfume, President & CEO, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), called Tuesday’s decision by the voters in Mississippi
to retain the Confederate emblem on the state's flag ‘deeply disappointing.’ Mfume said, ‘It is too bad that the voters of Mississippi have chosen to stay buried in the past instead of moving forward into the 21st century. That not withstanding, the NAACP will not give up its fight to remove from public property any and all symbols that celebrate the twisted philosophy of bigotry and hatred in this country.* ” I have been unable to find anyone who could define a “hate crime.” The consensus has been that it is when a White person does something undesirable or unacceptable to a Black person. The National Criminal Justice Reference Service defines it as “the violence of intolerance and bigotry, intended to hurt and intimidate someone because of their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or disability.” Now that certainly is a lot broader than just a Black/ White issue. If it were strictly such, as the NAACP and many would have us believe, then most hate crimes would be committed in the Southern states where the NAACP has concentrated its anti-hatred and anti-Southem movement There are, however, some interesting statistics released by the Federal Bureau of Investigation on “hate crimes.”
Consider those results and then ask yourself these questions.
■	Why are the top ten states in Hate Crimes almost all Northern states?
■	Could it be that Northerners are more aggressive, while Southerners are more defensive?
■	Why are the Southern states that fly their Confederate flags so low on the list?
■	Could it be that the NAACP is wrong in its assessment of the Southern people, their heritage and their culture?
■	Why are Florida, Texas and California so high on the list?
■	Could it be because of the much higher concentration Mexicans and Cuban ethnicities conflicting with the aggressive, sun seeking, retired people from the Northern states?
Even though Texas was the highest Southern state on the list, California had almost six times the number of hate crimes and that’s certainly not a Southern state.
While Florida came in at #13 it could hardly be called Southern anymore since all the Crackers were displaced to the mountains of North Georgia by retiring Yankees.
There are many conclusions that can be drawn from these statistics, but none to support what the NAACP says about the Southern people, their heritage, their culture or their flags.
The NAACP has failed in its mission, and survives today only on the hatred that can be incited in its own people. This
has become an injustice to the Southern people, a disgrace to democracy and a black eye to all Black people.

On busing Yankees to the Rosa Parks Bus Station
The Wheeler Plantation near Courtiand (“Pond Spring," says the AHC) was home to CSA Major General "Fighting Joe" Wheeler. Some want to rewrite that history.
By Ellen Williams
President, The Alabama Coalition ' It has recently come to the attention of those who have for 16 months traveled the length and breadth of this state opposing Lee Warner and his taxpayer-funded Alabama Historical Commission’s plans for transforming our state capitol; Cradle of the Confederacy, into a M.L.K. shrine glorifying the 1965 voting rights march, that, while we have been firing volley after volley to save the capitol, Warner and his minions were steadily at work cleansing the presence of General Joseph Wheeler from his own home, the Wheeler Plantation.
Should their scheme succeed, and frankly it is far gone, General Wheeler will be just one of those who inhabited the home he built; and his “story” just one of the many they will tell there at “Pond
Spring.” The person in overall charge has admitted to our investigator that “...he is being de-emphasized.” Well over one year ago, the AHC changed the name of Wheeler Plantation to “Pond Spring.” I was personally alarmed by that move, and called it to the attention of certain groups and people.
I assume that readers of this paper care for Confederate history in Alabama. It is fun to have a place to “chat” with others who feel as we do about this heritage, and share our frustration, but such venting does not accomplish anything.
Friends, there are too few in this state actively fighting what the AHC is doing to Confederate heritage and history. Many click computer keyboards and shout about things, but somehow it is never convenient
to do anything.
The battle to save our capitol is far from over. In fact, Warner and his group are now making forays into the towns of this state attempting to convince people just how wonderful a “marriage” of the Confederacy to the voting rights march would be, and how many tourist dollars the Montgomery bus station, as part of that union, might bring into the state.
Now we have the cleansing of General Wheeler at his home.
If you would like to actively oppose the AHC and Warner, contact me privately. But, please, only serious inquiries, as activism takes a lot of one’s time and often money too. No, I am not soliciting donations of any kind; we need people to accompany us on trips and to make long distance calls. Both are expensive.
Some of the front liners have already met privately and are working on plans as hard as we can; but we know that time and the might of the enemy are arrayed heavily against us. God Save the South.

July 2002 The First Freedom 5
Equality at last!
by Edgar J. Steele
I’ve given it a lot of thought and decided to get on board with equality, diversity and affirmative action. I think the world will be a much better place once we are all truly equal. So, right away. I’m calling for true equality in all things for all people everywhere in America.
Lessee now, blacks represent about 12% of the population last time I checked, with Latinos at some 13% and Asians of one flavor or another around 15%.
That means the Lakers will immediately have to drop several players from their roster and add a few others to meet the letter of the law in regard to true equality. Affirmative action should require a distribution of heights more closely conforming to that found in each population segment, too. Every time the ball moves up and down the court, I want to see six white guys and at least one Asian handing off to a Latino. In fact, affirmative action should require many of the new hoop stars to be midgets.
And pro football - sorry, guys, but you’re just gonna have to lavish those outlandish salaries on guys named Jose and Fred, too. I can hear it now: “And Chi Chan Chang throws a brutal downfield cross body block...Juan Hernandez laterals to Fred O’Hara just as he is forced out of bounds...O'Hara scores!”
Welfare will be more fairly distributed, 60% of it going to white people, of course; scholarships awarded according to skin color with affirmative action demanding a disproportionate number for stupid people of every stripe. Football scholarships have to go, in the main, to geeky little white guys wearing wire-rimmed glasses.
And it just isn’t fair that smart people get all the best grades, so they will have to be given harder exam questions. Minimum of twelve-syllables for all spelling bee words thrown at Merit Scholars.
Government at every level will be required to replace current employees until at least 60% in each and every department has a white face.
The employment opportunities for whites at airport security details alone are overwhelming.
Crime is tough, but we will just have to fund government programs designed to ensure that 60% of all crime is committed by white people. Rape: that’ll be toughest of all, but I just know that all those new Black victims, especially in prison, will bend to the greater good of society in the name of true equality.
Interracial crime undoubtedly will be the most difficult to fully integrate, since it may be necessary for a great many whites to give up their careers as surgeons and accountants and go into the rackets full time, thus ensuring a fifty-fold increase in white on black crime, thereby bringing it into conformity with today's black on white crime statistics.
Perhaps we could station government employees on street comers during riots to ensure that 60% of the color TVs are borne away by white folks.
We will need emergency funding at the federal level to properly equip white crack dealers and pimps, what with the price of gold for chains and teeth skyrocketing at present.
The murder rate bothers me most, for once we get whitey busy eliminating blacks at the same rate white people have been knifed, shot, strangled and beaten for years, it is entirely possible that we’ll run out of blacks altogether in a few months.
It would mean massive unemployment, as whites are thrown out of work from their jobs dealing crack and collecting welfare. Of course, we will have been having trouble getting enough unemployment checks into white hands, anyway, so maybe that is a proper result.
Now we’re cooking! Come to think of it, this equality thing has real possibilities. For example, is it really fair that only the good-looking guys get all the babes? □

— Alabama —
This event was sponsored by Sophie Bibb Chapter No. 65 United Daughters of the Confederacy and the General Edmund Winston Pettus Camp No. 574 Sons of Confederate Veterans, which does some type celebration of the President's birthday (June 3) every year on the Saturday closest to the actual date. Camp 574, in preparing for the 150th inaugural anniversary in nine years (when Jim Bazo. who portrays Jeff Davis, will be the exact same age at that time as the President when inaugurated), is staging the event this time near his birthday. The 150th of course will be on Feb. 18th. The 145th anniversary will probably also be celebrated at the Alabama Capitol on Feb. 18th, but don't be surprised if there's another one near June 3.
Jim Bazo is from Canada; the SCV flew him down from Ontario. The cast: Jefferson Davis, Jim Bazo; Alexander Stephens, Jerry Hicks; Howell Cobb, Mike Woodham; Rev. Manly, Philip Davis; Capt. George Jones, Ken McGhee; Ellen Noyes, Ellen Williams; Leroy Pope Walker, Steve Frazer; Jabez L.M. Cuny, Glenn Raines. Other cast members will be added in the near future. These photos and the accompanying article cover the history of this event based on detailed research by the writers, which explains the processions in and out of the Capitol Building as seen by the crowd gathered there on June 1, 2002.

The impartial and enlightened verdict of mankind will vindicate the rectitude of our conduct, and he, who knows the hearts of men, will judge of the sincerity with which we labored to preserve the government of our fathers in its spirit. The right solemnly proclaimed at the birth of the States and which has been affirmed and re-affirmed in the bills of rights of States subsequently admitted into the Union of 1789, undeniably recognizes in the people the power to resume the authority delegated for the purposes of government. Thus the sovereign States, here represented, proceeded to form this Confederacy, and it is by abuse of language that their act has been denominated a revolution. They formed a new alliance, but within each State its government has remained, and the rights of person and property have not been disturbed. The agent, through whom they communicated with foreign nations, is changed; but this does not necessarily interrupt their international relations.
Sustained by the consciousness that the transition from the former Union to the present Confederacy has not proceeded from a disregard on our part of just obligations, or any failure to perform any constitutional duty; moved by no interest or passion to invade the rights of others; anxious to cultivate peace and commerce with all nations, if we may not hope to avoid war, we may at least expect that posterity will acquit us of having needlessly engaged in it Doubly justified by the absence of wrong on our part, and by wanton aggression on the part of others, there can be no cause to doubt that the courage and patriotism of the people of the Confederate States will be found equal to any measures of defense which honor and security may require.
An agricultural people, whose chief interest is the export of a commodity required in every manufacturing country, our true policy is peace and the freest trade, which our necessities will permit It is alike our interest and that of all those to whom we would sell and from whom we would buy, that there should be fewest practicable restrictions upon the interchange of commodities. There can be but little rivalry between ours and any manufacturing or navigating community, such as the northeastern States of the American Union. It must follow, therefore, that a mutual interest would invite good will and kind offices. If, however, passion or the lust of dominion should cloud the judgment or inflame the ambition of those States, we must prepare to meet the emergency, and to maintain, by the final arbitrament of the sword, the position, which we have assumed among the nations of the earth. We have entered upon the career of independence, and it must be inflexibly pursued. Through many years of controversy with our late associates, the Northern States, we have vainly endeavored to secure tranquillity, and to obtain respect for the rights to which we are entitled. As a necessity, not a choice, we have resorted to the remedy of

separation; and henceforth our energies must be directed to the conduct of our own affairs, and the perpetuity of the Confederacy, which we have formed. If a just perception of mutual interest shall permit us peaceably to pursue our separate political career, my most earnest desire will have been fulfilled; but if this be denied to us, and the integrity of our territory and jurisdiction be assailed it, it will but remain for us, with firm resolve, to appeal to arms and invoke the blessings of Providence on a just cause.
As a consequence of our new condition, and with a view to meet anticipated wants, it will be necessary to provide for the speedy and efficient organization of branches of the Executive Department, having special charge of foreign intercourse, finance, military affairs, and the postal service.
For purposes of defense, the Confederate States may, under ordinary circumstances, rely mainly upon the militia; but it is deemed advisable, in the present condition of affairs, that there should be a well-instructed and disciplined army, more numerous than would usually be required on a peace establishment. I also suggest that, for the protection of our harbors and commerce on the high seas, a navy adapted to those objects will be required. These necessities have doubtless engaged the attention of Congress.
With a constitution differing only from that of our fathers, in so far as it is explanatory of their well-known intent, freed from the sectional conflicts which have interfered with the pursuit of the general welfare, it is not unreasonable to expect that States from which we have recently parted, may seek to unite their fortunes with ours under the government which we have instituted. For this your constitution makes adequate provision; but beyond this, if I mistake not, the judgment and will

God give us grace and courage, not we alone who came this day to reassert its legitimacy, but all who read these words: to challenge the reconstructed history being taught in today's federal indoctrination mills.

of the people, a re-union with the States from which we have separated is neither practicable nor desirable. To increase the power, develop the resources, and promote the happiness of the Confederacy, it is requisite that there should be so much homogeneity that the welfare of every portion shall be the aim of the whole. Where this does not exist, antagonisms are engendered which must and should result in separation.
Actuated solely by the desire to preserve our own rights and promote our own welfare, the separation of the Confederate States has been marked by no aggression upon others, and followed by no domestic convulsion. Our industrial pursuits have
received no check: the cultivation of our fields has progressed as heretofore; and even should we be involved in war, there would be no considerable diminution in the production of the staples which have constituted our exports, and in which the commercial world has an interest scarcely less than our own. This common interest of the producer and consumer can only be interrupted by an exterior force, which should obstruct its transmission to foreign markets - a course of conduct which would be as unjust towards us as it would be detri-. mental to manufacturing and commercial interests abroad. Should reason guide the action of the government from which we have separated, a policy so detrimental to the civilized world, the Northern States included, could not be dictated by even the strongest desire to inflict injury upon us; but if otherwise, a terrible responsibility will rest upon it, and the suffering of millions will bear testimony to the folly and wickedness of our aggressors. In the meantime, there will remain to us, besides the ordinary means before suggested, the well-known resources for retaliation upon the commerce of the enemy.

has conferred, has taught me that care, and toil, and disappointment, are the price of official elevation. You will see many errors to forgive, many deficiencies to tolerate, but you shall not find in me either a want of zeal or fidelity to the cause that is to me highest in hope and of most enduring affection. Your generosity has bestowed upon me an undeserved distinction - one which 1 never sought nor desired. Upon the continuance of that sentiment, and upon your wisdom and patriotism, I rely to direct and support me in the performance of the duty required at my hands.
We have changed the constituent parts but not the system of our government. The constitution formed by our fathers is that of these Confederates States, in their exposition of it; and, in the judicial construction it has received, we have a light that reveals its true meaning.
Thus instructed as to the just interpretation of the instrument, and ever remembering that all offices are but trusts held for the people, and that delegated powers are to be strictly construed, I will hope by due diligence in the performance of my duties, though 1 may disappoint your expectations, yet to retain, when retiring, something of the good will and confidence which welcomed my entrance into office.
It is joyous, in the midst of perilous times, to look around upon a people united in heart, where one purpose of high resolve animates and actuates the whole - where the sacrifices to be made are not weighed in the balance against honor, and right, and liberty, and equality. Obstacles may retard - they cannot long prevent - the progress of a movement sanctified by its justice, and sustained by a virtuous people. Reverently let us invoke the God of our fathers to guide and protect us in our efforts to perpetuate
the principles which, by his blessing, they were able to vindicate, establish, and transmit to their posterity, and with a continuance of his favor, ever gratefully acknowledged, we may hopefully look forward to success, to peace, and to prosperity n iliMPm
Contemporary newspapers described the inauguration of Davis in considerable detail. After Davis’ inaugural address, Howell Cobb, President of the Provisional Congress administered the oath.
“I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the Confederate States of America, and will, to the best of my ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution thereof.” (Confederate Constitution, Article 11, Section I).
After the Inaugural Address, Cobb stood, took the Bible from the table. Resting his left hand on it, and raising his right, Davis commenced his oath, he said ”So help me God”, then said it again, with his eyes raised skyward, and bent down to kiss the Bible in Cobb’s hand. It was done.
The people on the platform stood and began to re-enter the hall to conclude their secret session. Watts handed Ellen Noyes’s wreath to Davis and the President slipped it over his arm and began catching flowers and petals tossed down by the women on the balconies above. The editor from the “Advertiser” stepped up and grabbed the text of the Inauguration from his hand. The congregation on the platform re-entered the State house to conclude their secret session, finished the final business of the day and departed through the dispersing crowd, as Cobb joined Davis and Stevens in the carriage for the ride back to the Exchange Hotel. Davis spent the next few hours receiving callers.	□

4.	The Plaintiffs further pray that this court ORDER the Defendants to issue valid Alabama driver licenses as soon as practicable, if the Plaintiffs comply with all other provisions that are not related to Social Security Account numbers.
In the alternative, if the court finds that the Defendants did not act outside their scope of authority in denying application for, or renewal of, drivers licenses due to the absence of valid Social Security Account numbers, the Plaintiffs then pray that the following relief judgment be made:
1.	Insofar as Code of Alabama §§ xxx allow denial of, or renewal of, applications for Alabama driver's licenses: the statute is unconstitutional, in that it is violative of the 14th Amendment of the United States Constitution, as well as the Establishment Clause and Freedom Clause of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.
2.	The Plaintiffs further pray that, because xxx is unconstitutional, this court ORDER the Defendants to issue valid Alabama drivers licenses as soon as practicable, if the Plaintiffs comply with all other provisions that are not related to Social Security Account numbers.
THE PLAINTIFF DEMANDS A TRIAL BY JURY.

THE LINCOLN PUTSCH:
America’s B<
Defending Our Honor
David Allen
This 72 page paperback, intended to be short and inexpensive, is dedicated to all who have defended or fought for liberty. These historical facts, written by a Southern partisan, will fill in the gaps historians have left out, so that current and future generations can see where we have been and where we are going.
How to order Well, first, let's take a look at page 35:
.. .What about slavery? History books, media and the entertainment industry have misled today's Americans to believe the war was fought to free slaves. In order to believe this revisionist history, you have to ignore relevant facts concerning the issue.
According to the 1860 U.S. Census when slavery was at its peak, less than 6% of Southerners owned slaves. Less than 3% owned more than 5.
In President Lincoln's first inaugural address, he said, “I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the institution of slavery in the states where it exists. I believe I have no lawful right to do so.”
If the South had wanted to maintain slavery, the most logical position would be to remain in the Union. The Constitution, the Supreme Court, supported slavery. That process would have taken years, at no loss of life and little economic and financial loss.
Slave labor was being used to complete work on the capitol building in Washington, D.C. during the war. I.
And, picking up again on page 37:
... Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation is credited with “freeing slaves.** This is totally erroneous. He claimed to free the slaves in those states “in rebellion against the Union." It did not free any slaves in the states that remained in the Union. In other words, where he had no authority in the Confederate States of America since it was a separate country, he freed slaves; but, where he could have had some influence, he did nothing. Lincoln, contrary to popular belief, freed no slaves.
There is a strange irony about the Appomattox surrender of General Lee’s Army of Northern Virginia to Ulysses S. Grant, commander of the Union army. Grant did not free his slaves until 1865, two years after the Emancipation. Lee had freed his before the war.
Delaware was the last state to prohibit slavery. Delaware, of course, remained in the Union throughout the War Between the States,	  □

On self-government
By Publius Meridianus
It is with interest that I read about the various southern parties (small s), but here in Alabama we have nothing of any of that type that matters in the real world of politics. While republicans talk about some of the same values we Southrons hold, we are never going to permanently protect our heritage until we are free and independent. The democratic socialist party and the black republican party sold the South out a long time ago. So I've looked to the Libertarian as a third party here, and they are growing, with ballot access and a box on the income tax form to donate to alongside the aforementioned. Now, they certainly have some positions I find reprehensible. I have yet to find any political party that I’m altogether on the side of, because none are altogether on my/Dixie*s side!
In this search I would like to put together some positions from the League of the South and the Libertarian Party where we share similar thoughts. Y’all can check them out online at www.dixienet.org and www.lp.org. As election time nears, I urge all Southern Patriot/Nationalists to look at the LoS and LP for yourselves. Here are the two groups’ positions on the Right to Private Associations:
National Platform of the Libertarian Party, Adopted in Convention July 2000, Anaheim, California I. Individual Rights and Civil Order, Freedom of Association and Government Discrimination:
Individual rights should not be denied, abridged, or enhanced at the expense of other people’s rights by laws at any level of government based on sex, wealth, race, color, creed, age, national origin, personal habits, political preference, or sexual orientation.
We support repealing any such laws rather than extending them to all individuals.
Discrimination imposed by government has caused a multitude of problems. Anti-discrimination laws create the same problems. While we do not advocate private discrimination, we do not support any laws which attempt to limit or ban it The right to trade includes the right not to trade - for any reasons whatsoever, the right of association includes the right not to associate, for exercise of this right depends upon mutual consent.
A League of the South Position Paper [League of the South Logo]
On the Right of Free Association:
The League of the South disavows a spirit of malice toward any group and extends an offer of Christian goodwill and cooperation to all who wish to see the South a free and independent nation based on the principles of free association and ordered liberty. The League believes that all groups should be free to pursue their own interests without the help or hindrance of government, and since we support free association within local, self-governing communities, we think governments should force neither segregation nor integration. □

By George McDaniel Regardless of how “conservative” the Republican Party may or may not be, it is easy to forget that there was a time when the Party was far from conservative, that in the early days of the party, socialists and outright communists played an active role. In fact, it can and will be argued here that the election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860 was made possible by communists and socialists, most of them German immigrants in the Midwest, and indeed the prosecution of the War depended in large part on those same alien people. Consider, for example, the following.
Union General Franz Sigel had been a leader in the communist Revolution of 1848, a revolution fought to destroy the individual state governments of Germany, and forcibly unite them under an all-powerful central, socialist government Thanks to some inept leadership, part of it provided by the young Sigel, that revolution failed and Sigel, along with thousands of other “forty-eighters,” fled Europe for America, bringing their revolutionary socialist ideas with them. During the War, his troops declared, “I fights mit Sigel." After his disastrous retreat at the Battle of Wilson’s Creek, a Confederate song made fun of Sigel and his Hessian troops this way: Ven first I came from Lauterback I works sometimes by bakin’
Und next I runs my beer saloon,
Und den I try shoe-makin’,
But now I march mit musket out To save dot yankee eagle Dey dress me up in soldier clothes To go and fight mit Sigel.
Ralph Waldo Emerson, Massachusetts Yankee transcendentalist and hater of the South, wrote so approvingly of Sigel and his countrymen: “This revolution has a feature new to history, that of socialism."
Carl Shurz was another forty-eighter, who had met Karl Marx at the Democratic Club in Cologne. Schurz later went on to deliver the votes of 300,000 German immigrants to Lincoln in 1860. He was rewarded with an appointment as ambassador to Spain. War broke out just before his departure, but Lincoln prevailed upon him to go anyway. While in Spain, Schurz concluded (1) that the possibility of Europe recognizing the Confederacy was very real, and (2) that Lincoln should declare the War a crusade against slavery.

If the “opinion" expressed by the writer had not been so far off the truth chart, it would have qualified for comic relief.
The real dinosaurs in our midst are people like the writer of that pitiful piece of misinformation, who believe we Southerners need an education despite the fact that Southern schools are teaching falsehoods and outright lies from Yankee textbooks. We do, however, know the truth and we didn’t learn it from the same source as that writer! Had said writer bothered to learn the true facts of the Northern Invasion before inserting his/her foot into mouth, he/she would have learned that slavery was not the cause of the war. No matter how many times h is repeated, that still doesn’t make it true. I am sure the League of the South’s members present would have loved nothing better than to turn the day into one great big ol' teach-in, but, unfortunately, they were not allowed to do so. The writer, if actually present, might have learned something on that last day of school. Imagine - learning history in the classroom!
To the writer: you have much to learn
It was Schurz’s ideas and influence that eventually held sway with Lincoln, and resulted in the Emancipation Proclamation.
Communist communities were numerous in the North and the Midwest in the 1850s: Fruitlands at Concord, Mass.; the Owenite community of New Harmony, Indiana; the various Amanite communities in Iowa. Emerson’s own personal favorite communitarian was Fourier, who inspired a number of communist utopian communities and became the spiritual leader of Horace Greeley, the editor of the New York TYibune. Students of the War are well-acquainted with the role of Greeley and his newspaper. They may not be aware that the Tribune had avidly covered the Revolution of 1848, and frequently employed Karl Marx as a correspondent (In fact, Marx and Engels’ book. The Civil War in the U.S.y consists of collected articles and dispatches from the Tribune. In those pieces, the two inventors of Communism fret over every Union setback and cheer eveiy Union advance.)
Another communist community in the midwest was that of Comm uni a, Iowa, founded by a German immigrant named Wilhem Weitling, who had been one of the principal revolutionary figures in Europe as a leader of the communist organization known as the League of the Just Coming to America after the Revolution, he involved himself in a number of communist causes, included the Arbeiterbund, a German workers’ association, and in Communia. His life and ideals, which are detailed in his biography. The Utopian Communist, by Carl Wittke, present an excellent case study in communist revolutionary thought in America in the years leading up to the War.
These German immigrants were different, socially, religiously, and politically from those who had come before. Colonial German immigrants and those prior to 1848 were mainly farmers, a mixture of Lutherans and various small sects, all of whom were pious Christians. Most became Democrats. In America, they settled in Pennsylvania, then began to filter down the Great Wagon Road to places in the South such as Salem (now Winston-Salem), North Carolina. These Germans were
regarding the war. There are many good books available (When in the Course of Human Events, by Charles Adams, a Northerner, comes to mind as an excellent place to embark), which could begin your education and start healing your hatred of Southerners having Confederate ancestry. We don’t “hate” anyone. Regardless, once again, of how many times you throw it out there, that doesn’t make it so. You are the one filled with hatred, and it blinds you to the troth. Shed your blinders and educate yourself, so you won’t be tempted to offer information that creates divisiveness and furthers the agenda of hatred against Southerners. Or, is that your agenda?
If the writer truly hates Confederate Southerners and is offended by our history, heritage and culture, as I have told many others before. Interstates 35,45,55,65,75, 85 and 95 all run northward out of Dixie. You are free to take any one of them to your preferred destination. Just stop trying to inflict your Yankee propaganda on us Confederate Southerners who simply desire to be left alone, to honor our Confederate heroes and ancestors without having to constantly defend our right to do so against those who are ignorant of the facts.

Forty-eighters, on the other hand, came to America for its socialist promise, such as that of free land as was represented by the Homestead movement. Most settled in cities, however. They were rootless, with no particular attraction for a homeland. As Marx said, “The proletarian knows no fatherland." These Germans coming after 1848 were more urban, more educated, less willing to work and more apt to look to the welfare state. They tended to be irreligious, even atheistic.
The government of the city of Chicago in the 1850s and 1860s came strongly under German socialist influence. A forty-eighter, Dr. Ernst Schmidt, called “the Red Schmidt," ran for mayor on the Socialist party ticket in 1859 and received
12,000	of the 28,000 votes cast When another forty-eighter, Friedrich Hecker, called on Lincoln at the 1861 inauguration, Lincoln is said to have asked: “What became of that long, red-haired Dutchman [German], Dr. Schmidt? Almost every Dutchman has been in here asking for a job; why doesn't he come in?" Most of them, one might add, came away happy.
The Revolution of 1848 was in some respects a reverse image of the War for Southern Independence. Germany, which existed as hardly more than an abstraction, was in fact a decentralized collection of autonomous states. In keeping with the Marxist emphasis on the large, omnipotent, central government, these so-called “revolutionaries" were actually intent on I overthrowing local rule and setting up a totalitarian dictatorship. Such socialist “reformers" included, in addition to those already mentioned, one August von Willich, future brigadier of the Ninth Ohio and the 32nd Indiana. Von Willich had been an ardent follower of Karl Marx and had once led a Communist mob against the Cologne City Hall. Though at times a rabble rouser, Willich was a military man through and through. At Shiloh, he amazed his fellow officers (including Gen. Lew Wallace, who described it) by putting his men through the manual of arms drill while under Confederate fire, even as many of them were being shot down. Willich, known for his regimental drills even after 20-mile marches, was prone to address his men as “Citizens of Indiana" and lecture them at length on the virtues of communism.
Alexander von Schimmelfennig was another German revolutionary who became a Union general. So was General Max von Weber, who had served as a colonel under Sigel in the revolution. So too was Karl Leopold Matthies of Iowa.
In the lower ranks, the former German revolutionaries were even better represented. Among them were Lt Colonel Carl Gottfried Freudenberg. who had led insurgents at the age of 15 in an engagement near Mannheim, and the Austrian Ernest Fahtz, who became Lt. Colonel of the 8th Maryland. There was also Dr. Friedrich Hecker, who had been a leader in the Baden, Germany, rebellion. Another was Col. George von Amsberg, who had been a leader in the socialist revolt in Hungary. Adolf Dengler, a Baden Revolution veteran, was the colonel of the 43rd Illinois. Colonels Joseph Gerhardt, Carl Eberhard Salomon, Wilhelm Heine, Konrad Krez, Henry Flad, Fritz Anneke, Franz Mahler, Adolf von Hartung, Edward Kapff, August Mersey, Friedrich Poschner, Franz Wutschel, Rudolf von Rosa, and other such names form a list that goes on and on. All of them were socialists, all of them were Union officers. There were at least fifty German-born majors, though that number is probably far too low. Most of these men were from Midwestern states: Ohio, Illinois, Missouri, Iowa, and Wisconsin.
As far as enlisted men were concerned, the number of Germans, most of whom had also seen service in the Revolutionary armies, was, literally, legion. In New York City alone, thousands of Germans volunteered immediately after Fort Sumter. New
— Rethinking the revolution —
York state had 10 purely German regiments during the war. The NY German regiments included: the Steuben Rifles, Blenker's 8th NY, the Astor Rifles, the German Rifles No. 5, the SchwarzeJager, and the German Rifles No. 3. Blenker's Regiment was reviewed by Gen. Winfield Scott and Lincoln in June, 1861, during which Scott called them “the best regiment we now have."
The preponderance of German-bom officers and men in the Union armies is overwhelming. It is estimated that in I860 there were approximately 1,204,075 Germans in the states that would remain in the Union. During the War, approximately
100.000	additional Germans entered. That makes for a total of about 1,300,000 Germans living in the Union during the War years. It is calculated that about 118,402 would have been subject to military service. The number who actually served was by some estimates around 216,000. This means the Germans were overrepresented by nearly 100,000 men. Of the total of those serving, at least 36,000 served under German officers. If the total number of German troops is assumed to be
216.000	and we accept that the total of all foreign-bom troops was nearly 500,000, which was about one-quarter of all Union troops, we see that as many as 1 in every 4 Union troops was actually of foreign birth, and that such foreigner was as apt to be a German as not. This is an astonishing statistic, and bears out the widely held Confederate belief that they were fighting an army of Hessians.
What were the political beliefs of these men? As noted above, a great many of the Germans, and virtually all those who had arrived since 1848, were former revolutionaries, and socialist in political orientation. Many were imbued with the Liberal ideas that had come into prominence in Europe with the Jacobins in the French Revolution, and had remained around in various guises ever since. In America, these radicals retained their beliefs, finding encouragement in such something-for-nothing policies as the Homestead movement. Most of the recent immigrants came to be free-soilers. Combined with their Liberal antipathy to slavery, and their ideological devotion to omnipotent central government, they were thus natural-bom Unionists.
An interesting phenomenon in 1860 was the “Wide-Awake Club" movement. Wide-Awake Clubs were paramilitary German and Scandinavian Republican organizations founded to promote the Lincoln cause. A Wide-Awake Club was founded in Washington, DC, and in three days signed up over 50 members, most of whom were German Jews.
A large number of German-language newspapers were published throughout the Union, particularly in the Midwest. An example was the Illinois Staats-Zeitung, which was virulently anti-Southern. In an ironic twist on the modem-day “Southern Swastika" slander, that newspaper coined a term for the Confederate flag: Klapper-schangenflagge (rattlesnake flag). Throughout the war, it spewed forth hate for the South that rivaled any coming out of New England.
Lincoln realized the power of the Germans in this region. The German vote was viewed as essential in the election of 1860. Carl Schurz was the chairman of the Wisconsin delegation to the Republican convention in Chicago. Schurz, whose communist credentials in Germany were impeccable, was also a member of the Republican National Committee. Germans such as Gustav Komer, Francis Lieber, Friedrich Hassaurek, Frederick Munch, and Judge Krekel all spoke forcefully for Lincoln. Schurz alone traveled an astounding 21,000 miles speaking on behalf of Lincoln, for whom he promised and delivered 300,000 German votes.
Numerous historians have held that the foreign-bom (primarily German) vote in the Upper Midwest decided the outcome of that election. For example, in a widely
quoted essay in the American Historical Review, July 1911, entitled “The Fight for the Northwest, I860," William Dodd analyzed the I860 vote. He concluded that the Republicans made a concerted effort to win over the votes of the new German immigrants, through their support of high tariffs and free homesteads, in addition to liberal ideologizing. Dodd wrote that Indiana, Illinois, and Iowa “would have given their electoral votes to Douglas but for the loyal support of the Germans and other foreign citizens led by Carl Schurz, Gustave Koemer, and the editors of the Staatszeitung of Chicago." He concluded that had one voter in twenty switched from Lincoln to Douglas, Lincoln would have lost the upper midwest and hence the election. Dodd wrote: “The election of Lincoln and, as it turned out, the fate of the Union, were thus determined not by native Americans but by voters who knew least of American history and institutions."
The chief exponent of the philosophy of most of these people was Karl Marx. The extremely pro-Union, anti-Southern writings of Marx and his colleague Friedrich Engels echo the attitude of his German followers as we have discussed here. In addition, his later followers, the Soviet Russians, adopted similar positions in their official histories of the WBTS. To quote one Soviet historian, D.B. Petrov, who commemorated the 150th anniversary of Lincoln's birth by writing his biography (Abraham Lincol’n, Moscow, 1959): “Lincoln sincerely sympathized with the workers and sought the fulfillment of their most important demands. In this, lay the main reason for Lincoln's authority among the common voters." The Confederacy, on the other hand, is reviled in official Soviet history: “The secession movement was not a struggle for the sovereign rights of states but a reactionary rebellion of slaveholders, speculating on the ideal of states' rights." (R.F. Ivanov, The Civil War in the USA. Moscow, 1960j. According to Ivanov, the secessionist slaveholders “vigorously suppressed'* all opposition; therefore, secession was an “anti-peoples movement" Notice that these Soviet writings were published at the height of the Cold War, yet the writers are adamant to defend the U.S. Federal government. Why would they defend their supposed arch-enemy?
A look at the events that took place thirty years later in the “Evil Empire" (one is tempted to refer to it as the “Other Evil Empire") will reveal the answer. Aside from the fact that Lincoln has long been a hero in the Communist world (witness the

Summary A forgotten chapter in the history of America is the influence of German communists in the Midwest in the years following 1848. Refugees numbering in the many thousands from the failed communist Revolution of 1848 settled there, bringing with them socialist ideas favoring large central government, land redistribution, and abolitionism.
These people avidly supported the election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860, providing what many believe was the margin of victory. In response to Lincoln's call for troops, they joined the Union Army in large numbers, forming perhaps one out of eight of all Union troops in the field, a great many of them under German officers, themselves communist veterans. In the civilian sphere, socialists and communists formed a powerful element in the Republican Party, and Lincoln, himself a Midwesterner who shared much of their world view, awarded them with major appointments.

Introduction to The Leuchter Report
The following was published over ten years ago, so, no doubt it's old news to you. It9s not?
Then let's consider how it might have escaped your attention. First, do you depend on the same elites for news who finance most of the world's wars and own most of its newspapers? We're getting warm.
The full story by this writer is at http://www.fpp. co. uk/A usch witz/ Leuchter/index.html
By David Irving
Unlike the writing of history, chemistry is an exact science. Old fashioned historians have always conducted endless learned debates about meanings and interpretations, and the more indolent among them have developed a subsidiary Black Art of “reading between the lines,” as a substitute for wading into the archives of World War II documents which are now available in embarrassing abundance.
Recently, however, the more daring modem historians have begun using the tools of forensic science - carbon-dating, gas chromatography, and simple ink-aging tests — to examine, and not infrequently dispel, some of the more tenaciously held myths of the twentieth century.
Sometimes the public is receptive to the results, sometimes not The negative result of the laboratory analysis of the ancient Shroud of Turin is one example: it is not a deliberate fake, perhaps, but nor was it nearly as old as the priests would have had centuries of gullible tourists believe.
It is unlikely that the world's public will be as receptive yet to the results of the professional and dispassionate chemical examination of die remains of the wartime Auschwitz concentration camp which is at the centre of this report.
Nobody likes to be swindled, still less where considerable sums of money are involved. (Since 1949 the State of Israel has received over 90 billion Deutschmarks in voluntary reparations from West Germany, essentially in atonement for
the “gas chambers of Auschwitz.”) And this myth will not die easily: Too many hundreds of millions of honest, intelligent people have been duped by the well-financed and brilliantly successful postwar publicity campaign which followed on from the original ingenious plan of the British Psychological Warfare Executive (PWE) in 1942 to spread to the world the propaganda story that the Germans were using “gas chambers” to kill millions of Jews and other “undesirables”
As late as August 1943 the head of the PWE minuted the Cabinet secretly that despite the stories they were putting out, there was not the slightest evidence that such contraptions existed, and he continued with a warning that stories from Jewish sources in this connection were particularly suspect.
As a historian I have, on occasion, had recourse to fraud laboratories to test controversial documents for their authenticity. In the late 1960s I discarded certain diaries of Vice Admiral Wilhelm Canaris, offered to myself and the publishers William Collins Ltd., since Messrs. Hehner A Cox Ltd. of the City of London advised me that the ink used for one signature did not exist during the war years. It was I who exposed the “Hitler Diaries” as fakes, at Der Stern k famous international press conference in Hamburg in April 1983.
And yet I have to admit that it would never have occurred to me to subject the actual fabric of the Auschwitz concentration camp and its “gas chambers” - the holiest shrines of this new Twentieth Century religion - to chemical tests to see if there was any trace of cyanide compounds in the walls.
The truly astounding results are as set out in this report: while significant quantities of cyanide compounds were found in the small de-lousing facilities of the camp where the proprietary (and lethal) Zyklon B compound was used, as all are agreed, to disinfect the plague-ridden clothing of all persons entering these brutal slave-labour camps, no significant trace whatsoever was found in the buildings which international opinion - for it is not more than that - has always labeled as the camp's infamous gas chambers. Nor, as the report's gruesomely expert author makes plain, could the design and construction of those buildings have made their use as mass gas-chambers feasible under any circumstances.
For myself shown this evidence for the first time when called as an expert witness at the ZQndel trial in Toronto in April 1988, the laboratory reports were shattering. There could be no doubt as to their integrity. I myself would, admittedly, have preferred to see more rigorous methods used in identifying and certifying the samples taken for analysis, but I accept without reservation the difficulties that the
Intensive Sensitivity I
By Olaf Childress
Bedford: A World Vision By EUen Williams Guardian Books, S15.95
This futuristic novel is not that futuristic nor novel: the setting, around 2018, a vision more of decline than anything surprising. A writer’s initial attempt, frankly, the first ten pages blunder along suchwise that I was about to put it aside as hopeless when it occurred to me how often we Southerners get accused of insensitivity; and here was a retired teacher’s takeoff on hypersensitivity therapy for Whites only in the multicultural madness of Bedford, a small rural Alabama town. So I struggled onward, ignoring a few typos and misspellings, giving that first evening a fair hearing of six chapters.
The Area-state of Alabama vs. Horace and Virginia Pruitt was itself a hearing for you and me, as North America II's Area Court set about convicting the pair of child abuse. They had regularly and admittedly brought their 14-year-old son, against his
will, to Bethel Baptist - the last holdout against Bedford High School’s “norms.”
Another half dozen short chapters at the next sitting had me noticing these snappy sentences, interrupted scenes and unusual story structuring were cleverly paced. A desperate mother pleads to regain custody of her boy, and the father finally signs an edict that he will drop young Adam off each Sunday at the approved church on their way to Bethel Baptist.
This drama shifts often between school and church. By the close of a fourth session and chapter 24, wiping a tear from my eye I'm completely absorbed; were there really lapses of syntax back there at the start? This is the way people talk here in the Bible Belt. And, despite PCTV stereotypes, they do think
It's Mother's Day as the parents sit in on their son's first visit to Oakpark. The church bulletin congratulates all mothers of both (all?) sexes, announcing the marriage of two young men members - to each other. And where we cowards may be headed? □
examining team faced on location in what is now Poland: chiseling out the samples from the hallowed site under the very noses of the new camp guards. The video tapes made simultaneously by the team - which I have studied — provide compelling visual evidence of the scrupulous methods that they used.
Until the end of this tragic century there will always be incorrigible historians, statesmen, and publicists who are content to believe, or have no economically viable alternative but to believe, that the Nazis used “gas chambers” at Auschwitz to kill human beings. But it is now up to them to explain to me as an intelligent and critical student of modem history why there is no significant trace of any cyanide compound in the building which they have always identified as the former gas chambers.
Forensic chemistry is, I repeat, an exact science.
The ball is in their court
FRED A. LEUCHTER, Jr., America’s leading specialist on the design and fabrication of execution equipment, including homicidal gas chambers: His expertise has been confirmed by state governments and in periodicals such as The Atlantic (Feb. 1990) and The New York Times (Oct. 13,1990). Receiving a B.A. from Boston University in 1964 he did postgraduate work at the Harvard Smithsonian Astrophysics! Observatory in Cambridge, Mass. Leuchter holds patents for numerous highly sophisticated technical devices, including sextants, surveying instruments and optical encoding equipment. In spite of intense pressure to repudiate his findings, Leuchter defiantly stands by his 1988 investigation of the alleged extermination gas chambers. As a result, powerful special interest groups have made him the target of a vicious campaign of slander, and have succeeded in all but destroying his career. He has been banned from Britain.

Our country’s future
By Thomas H. Smith
Shortly after Michail Gorbachev presided over the collapse of the Soviet Union, he said, “We (communism) couldn’t defeat capitalism militarily, but now we will defeat them so smoothly they won’t even know what happened
I didn’t have a clue at that time what he meant. Now it’s loud and clear: He was referring to the New World Order, global governance, or whatever you want to call it. It’s socialism, or communism, under a new name. More importantly, it is backed strongly by super-wealthy, international bankers (the Rothschilds, Oppenheimers, Mellons, etc). Their interest isn’t capitalism or socialism, but controlling the world’s economy! Their strongest and most secret organization to accomplish this goal is called the Bilderbergs, an organization of top political leaders from around the world. However, they also control the Trilateral Commission and the Council on Foreign Relations.
This secret organization, plotting the subversion of our country and constitution, met in the Washington, D.C. area May 30 to June 2. You did not hear this on TV nor read it in any of the major newspapers. Why was this news suppressed?
Read on.
Recall the government's surprise sweep of all security employees at the three airports around Washington in late April? I believe they fired 81 employees with shaky backgrounds. In my opinion this security check was solely to protect “distinguished” politicians coming to Washington for the Bilderbeig meet.
The number one item on their agenda was to convince the U.S. to attack Iraq! The dust had barely settled after their meeting at the Westfields Marriot Hotel near Dulles Airport when Tom Daschle rushed to the White House and urged President Bush to attack Iraq. Other prominent Democrats and Republicans joined with him in calling the President to “get Saddam now.” Fortunately, most of the representatives from Europe were urging restraint rather than agreeing on a reckless rush to war. However, will their opinions be considered by the White House?
Our top military leaders strongly advise the President that we are not militarily prepared for war with Iraq and the possible added consequences which such an act entails.
Do you think that these people, the Bilderbergs, should be deciding when and where the U.S. sends our soldiers to war? I certainly do not!
What is going on in this country? Well, one must look below the surface, but it's easy to find. Our society is becoming one of the most corrupt in history. Did you read that article in the newspaper from across the bay about sex in the classroom at the University of California at Berkeley? It was disgusting, to put it mildly. Yet, just
last month while 1 was in Annapolis, MD, eleven and twelve-year-old children were doing the very same thing in their middle school classroom. Three weeks later, we still do not know where the teacher was while this was going on. Worse yet, I saw not one letter to the editor in the local newspaper from an irate parent. “Hey, what the heck, kids will be kids! If the President can do it..!” seems to be the attitude. Well, why not! Thai’s about all they see in movies, on TV and the internet Have you watched “Friends” on NBC? I don’t think you can see or hear more trash than is on that show. NBC is owned by GE, whose slogan is, “We bring good things to life!” How ironic.
For several years my internet website nationaJdebt.com fought what I considered in 1993 the biggest problem facing our country. But, after some time, I altered the theme to “corruption in government,” our real dilemma!
Not changing the subject, but, did you watch the life of Pope John Paul II on April 20th? It was an exceptionally fine program about a wonderful man. However, I was somewhat shocked at a remark attributed to him near the end of the program: “Capitalism and corruption cannot long endure!” Then the impact hit me. He is saying exactly what I have thought for the past few years. Our government is corrupt, the Federal Reserve banking system is hugely corrupt, our society is corrupt, the Catholic Church has major problems with some of the clergy, many of our schools are comipt, and the stock market is suffering from the impact of corporate corruption. On top of all this, we allow into our country subversives (Bilderberg) plotting to tear down our constitution and replace it with a New World Order, and the newspapers and TV ignore what's going on because they aren't allowed to report the story (See Bernard Goldberg’s book. Bias, which only touches the tip of that iceberg).
Do I have the solution to this mess? Unfortunately, I do not Frankly, I believe it is far too late. President Bush wants Congress to grant “fast track” negotiating powers so he can establish free trade in the American hemisphere. The formation of a free trade market is step one in establishing an American Union similar to the European Union. The target date set by the United Nations for this to be accomplished is the year 2005. The next key date is for an Asian Union by year 2010. Then all the pieces will be in place to establish global government and end the Constitution of the United States.
Perhaps you think President Bush will never let this happen? Guess again!
Thank God, I will probably not be around to witness this treason.

(That internet post, relayed as it came in, “All-Jew network tonight to teach your children how to be queers - please warn all parents • pass it on" headlined “Nickelodeon to Air Gay Parent Special" drew several “unsubscribe" retorts. Just because 99% of the media are controlled by Jews, you can’t lump ns all together, they say. Of coarse not, but, with 1% of the media listening, we Confederates are “reconstructing" the “facts," thank yon. Go thou, Judah, and do likewise. -Ed.)
“Parents are upset because many thought they never had to worry about Nickelodeon’s content," she said. Frankly, any parent that felt safe “until now" really has not been paying attention. We noticed the crude kids* programming five years ago. Cartoon Network as well, canceled cable in 1998 and use the TV only as a box to watch video tapes.

Resolution on Restoring Balance by Repealing the 17th Amendment
Whereas, this nation, the greatest in history, was founded on a newly written Constitution, establishing that the right to govern comes from the governed - the right of the people to rule themselves, recognizing that this right is protected by the balance of power as originally set for in the Constitution of the United States of America, and

CON-SWERVE-ATIVE Mr. Harold Sorensen:
—You seem to have a personal impression or information from some source suggesting that I do not attempt to attend to the requests and needs of my constituents.
I regret that you have been misled. I have consistently during my public service earned a reputation of helping my constituents. I invite you to inquire of anyone who knows me well and I am confident you will get that response. In addition, I have a very conservative voting record and have been endorsed in every election I have run by the Christian Coalition, the National Rifle Association, the Eagle Forum, all the Pro-Life groups, and many other conservative organizations...

AFTER THE PRIMARY Thanks for the endorsement notice for GOP Executive Committee. I didn’t make it, but it was pretty close against a moderate who has run for Governor and owns a big business. I love the paper and will send for a subscription. As a note, re: the election. I think it's imperative we unite behind Riley for one reason. Pushing him to a huge win can help us get conservatives in office on his coattails. We have to use opportunities to get our people elected where and when we can. He was 3rd on my list too, but for P.R. reasons he can probably beat D.S. and help carry some others in who might be worth their salt. DON WALLACE

NOW therefore, we, the people of the Utah Republican Party gathered in Convention, do resolve that the Utah Republican Party adopts this
Resolution: To restore and preserve states* rights, we support an amendment to repeal the 17th Amendment of the United States Constitution in its entirety and restore the original Article 1 Section 3.1: “The Senate of the United States will be composed of two Senators from each state, chosen by the legislature thereof, for six years. Each Senator will have one vote." With this resolve we dedicate all reasonable means to invite other states to join us in this urgent matter. Be it therefore further resolved, that the repeal of the 17th Amendment and restoration of Article I Section 3.1 of the United States Constitution should be included in the Utah Republican Parly State Party Platform.	□

You white guys stay off your farms
I know the place isn’t on many people's mind* You might remember that, before it became Zimbabwe. Rhodesia was called the breadbasket of Africa. There were thousands of farms in Rhodesia that were and had been fanned by white families for over 100 years. The bustling economy, well-paying form jobs and high standard of living created by the natives of Rhodesia started attracting Africans from throughout
the continent. Eventually black African immigrants had become an overwhelming majority of Rhodesia's citizens.
Exit Rhodesia, enter Zimbabwe, and soon former communist guerrilla Robert Mugabe. Engaged in his own personal form of ethnic cleansing for some time now, his goons have been murdering white formers who refused to leave their lands. He recently signed legislation, if that's
This story was censored by the mediacracy elsewhere
what you want to call it, which mandates the confiscation of all white-owned farms in Zimbabwe and the redistribution of these lands to black Africans. Zimbabwe, on the edge of famine, citizens starving, is no longer the breadbasket of Africa. As of midnight the other day whites arc no longer permitted to set foot on their farmland. Crops are left in the fields to die. These white formers can’t even step onto their
farmland to provide feed and water to their cattle. The evil whites now have 44 days to turn over their property, all of it, to Mugabe's goons.
You haven’t heard about all of this? You wonder where the banner headlines, the outrage? Sony - blacks kicking whites off their land just doesn't meet the basic standards for world media outrage.

Terminal Phase	By Olaf Childress	Online	democracy
the worldwide network with new accounts at a phenomenal rate, and, before we were quite ready for all that, overbuilding like
Online democracy should begin with the acceptance, by everyone expecting to be a part of h, that vigilance is a citizen's first duty. The incredibly patient American taxpayer, tired of fighting one tax increase after another, knows something has to give. He must demand that each incumbent legislator presently state his position on moving toward true accountability.
Regarding the transition: can my own “representative.*' far above us constituents except for the sightseeing tour on our visit to the capitol, dismount from that tax-and-spend attitude and practice what the name implies? Or, will he keep voting his better judgment, counting on such good press as put him in office to reassert its powerful influence come election time? How long should the media get away with this theory that deliberation, arm-twisting and the secret expediencies of realpolitik preclude such a consultative relationship with the people’s hired emissaries?
Citizen volunteer legions will be needed in this crucial phase, and getting the job done means turning off that PCTV box five days a week. But, wow, see here! The advertisers notice, respond to our boycott, and call for accountability: directing the surviving programs away from such mind-rot, and leaving One World Utopians wondering where their next “ism.”
A citizen advising his elected rep how to vote each issue should be no problem, as discretion remains the responsibility of our public trustee. But some means for dealing with intolerable abuse of those residual powers, i.e., any breach of contract, must bring swift correction. The representative has to swear that, when online constituents communicate preferences to his office per their chosen standard, such transmissions will instantly be accounted, verified, and the current tally published on his website; furthermore that, should such preliminary consensus by democratic vote be to his thinking unwise, he will plead the case for reconsideration within a prescribed period of deliberation, then assert his informed judgment
To see why this empowered franchise and its empowered representative is not a non sequitur requires discarding that old media concept of a “living constitution.*’ Let us study the Founders * intents, learn the legal process for amending America’s charier, for protecting our better interests and for seceding when federal “guidelines” grow unbearably intrusive. Washington, Madison, Jefferson and Franklin allowed theirs no final word, merely a temporal awareness of higher law. They, having had no desire to be fixtures in King George’s empire - unlike the Utopians - understood morion as life’s spice and essence. Ours the same challenge, merely a new stage upon which the internet's dangerous options summon new patriots out from the wings. It’s time to enter, men.
The sovereign State of Alabama, until invaded by Lincoln’s Yankee hordes, was happily faithful to that U.S. Constitution; then Mama Media's Reconstruction took over. New and unratffled amendments, the first planks on the road to Utopia, were laid by those engineers of a different document.
Let us put this egalitarian myth behind. It's time for a state government of online democracy whereby the people's mandate gets transmitted through their proxy agents employed for such office more often than directly; so that a member of the electorate, busy with other pursuits and insufficiently
aware of all pertinencies for a bill under consideration, might assign private agent ND to exercise his franchise if it concerns national defense, or, for public transit, agent PT, and so on.
Yes, ours is a representative rather than a “true"democracy; I'm not disputing that. But today's monstrous interpretation of it is Stalin's and Lincoln's, and without legitimacy. Let us rethink the wherefrom and the whither of self-government.
Sitting magistrates will hear our petition soon enough. After which, private interests can, by the initiative and referendum, start proposing and formalizing such legislative categories as called for, that into these we voters may posit our concerns wherever appropriate.
Online democracy must necessarily find a citizen worthy of the franchise retaining only qualified proxies who share his views. Such delegates, expert in specialized legal areas, might be recalled at any time for whatever reason, as the employer reserves his sovereign right and duty to overrule errancy by voting unassigned bills directly.
Retire the incumbent lawmakers? No, our new cadre of plebeians just keep tabs, transmitting to them the opinions of their constituents more precisely than the media have cared to do, by way of non-binding advisories. His future clientele will result from a proxy’s first voting record, with the internet qui custodiet eum.
Won’t that create a new bureaucracy? Yes, but not supported by taxes: one that can be trimmed.
Does such a scheme eliminate from the voting process all who can’t read English and keep up with our state’s technological unity? Affirmative.
Maintaining the voter lists clear of nontaxpayers, nonentities and indigents should indeed require eternal vigilance. With the danger of special interests buying up franchises only too real, and inasmuch as no manmade system has ever enjoyed permanent existence, online democracy is not touted as such; it is rather a means for communicating today’s public desires. Not to be idealized beyond what we grasp at the moment, efforts by statute merely aiming for its implementation: the law remains our sole certainty. Some people are incapable of this distinction.
Online democracy’s debut is near at hand. As stated, such factual observation is not advocacy, but fear and trepidation of what will happen if, dawdling rather than going out to meet it, we again deputize, by default, the international moneychangers. Our agents may not cross “bridges of no return,** but those madmen envision a sweet world order over there.
Let’s hope and pray elitist propaganda and the Big Lie can be outflanked in our own time, though vigilance against their recurrence might never lapse safely. Such a hideous humanist plot comes on time, serves its purpose, reawakens us to dangers and opportunities.
With these checks in place, automatic macro instructions must expose not only the deviant vote of a representative in Bay Minette or Montgomery electronically, but of any digressing proxy in between, so that a private agent hoping to stay in business when in doubt would consult the opinion closer to his source of authority than in the direction of specialists. But who, from the private sector, could make it happen; what plebe trusted to study and recommend the right vote in harmony with his sovereign
individual's predilection?
Wizards of disinformation, to thwart the entire project, might portray themselves as all things to all people while soliciting the trust of a large franchise clientele. Is that a problem? With the first aspirant proxies showing blank slates, who would retain them? Nobody. But, a blank slate? Surely this plebeian for hire has a few comrades? Associates? A mother? Where do we start?
It’s done! Just now, someone had called, inquiring of me for whom to vote; and I, in exchange for that stroking of my ego, was glad to oblige.
Let such all-out skepticism as might be expected engender an acute awareness of these inherent dangers. At this historical moment of truth, either the people will self-start or prove unworthy, by default, of self-rule. The demagogue presence ever a given, only the info highway is new. Its brainy technicians initially having had no ties to the elite enemy, their skills shaped the tools, not the ends to which these may be applied. Devising such technologically safe communications channels as required by these modem data-tracking imperatives indicates research and development of the utmost sensitive instruments and programs computer science can come up with - and for programers to put ethics before artifice.
Our dream of self-government is within reach. The Greek word elektor, beaming sun, and the Latin electrum, amber (which was charged by friction), both suggested electus. choice, to ancient races unaware of the phenomena to come; or of the amazing postmodern conflux of their words for choosing with ours for the means of choice. Electronic delegating requires us to explore ways for assigning multiple areas of legislation to committees as heretofore, but suchwise that constitutional restraints, expert advice and recorded votes are the norm, the essentials - without systemizing the whole thing to death by bureaucracy.
In other words, to quote Marx ironically, the taxpayer-employer’s proxy will agitate for a withering away of such work as macro instructed hardware can handle more efficiently, since that's what his voter wants. But, must the agent not then forfeit his job, having performed it too well? No, and this is hard for the narrowly focused to understand. The powers of his client will be increased by retaining that consultant. We are not considering online democracy as the only vehicle in cyberspace. Reliable leadership can draw together an economy of like-minded numbers, a single provider serving many franchises paying but small dues.
It’s true that, if the aggregate of them is predictable, those less popular delegate agencies must come and go according to market competition. How much should an online user pay for services, and ho w many customers at that rate does the start-up proxy need? Does this agency have a small statewide clientele drawn to its views and expertise in a certain category ? Or, perhaps it serves as a switchboard between clients within a single state for all their specialized consultants? A once-and- forever answer crafted by some tenured bureaucrat is not what we’re after.
By 1995, the early indications of what’s coming began taking shape. Everywhere, our telephone and cable-TV companies were laying underground fiber-optic lines, conducting seminars to inform the public of expanding services, floating preliminary enticements to attract customers, loading
the California gold rush. Nobody knew where it was headed.
The pioneers of the industry and the latecomers, the hucksters and the seers, all were there. A little plastic card having sneaked into everybody's billfold or purse was zipped through cash register slots at once verifying or denying electronically the credit of each individual purchaser, adding the approved charges to his single end-of-month billing cycle. The biggest manufacturers of computers, printers, hi-def TVs, software and so on had long since gone international, freely exchanging components, labels and officers between themselves; seeking out from among the proffered tax enticements and “services” of expanding governments those favors which increased profits. Depending on their staff lawyers to escape the worst of such One World intrusions while enjoying the taxpayer shakedowns. New Deals were constantly being cut with this latest gaggle of intellectuals seeking control by waving FDR’s same old carrot and stick.
Those centra] planners - by finagling trade and banking agreements, interest and exchange rates, immigration and foreign aid policies - herded such industrial giants, victims of their own greed, along the same paths we, the coward people, bad teamed to trudge: toward socialism and total power for the Jew World Order.
The international conglomerates would be nominally subject to more stringent workplace safety requirements and hiring quotas, etc., than small businesses, though bureaucrats were always ready to negotiate with their batteries of lawyers. The dictates having been designed to shackle only American traffic, our domestic economy was raped in proportion as profits soared for directors exporting manufacturing jobs.
Trade pacts, protective tariffs, whatever exceptions winked at, those powerhouses • harking to the (understood) order received every preferential treatment needed to shut out the smaller businesses which wouldn't heel. It was essential for the rule makers to control this information highway, link up the consenting big players regardless of motives, and keep track of that cadre being taught to direct the workers of the world.
The old cliche that capitalists would sell the enemy enough rope to hang themselves having mutated to fiber-optic cable when the internet expanded in the 1990s, our government-industrial complex's growing dependence on processed information set them up for the tightening noose, leaving only the small businessman (resolved not to stand also on that gallows) to ask: Who controls the computer terminals?
By then, of course, both politicians and academicians were held “equally” in low esteem. Lacking either the courage or the intellect (in any event failing) to stop this utopian steamroller, many who thought themselves leaders had betrayed an older generation inured to “tolerance” of them, and confused younger arrivals who might have kept their nihilist religion “separate” from the state - by relegating it back into the closet and loosening again a “diversity” of opinions.
So, was Orwell’s vision prophetic, or merely admonitory? Today with all the central-planning notions deposed, shall a faulty ideology and its teachers remain by tenure? These are timely questions.
