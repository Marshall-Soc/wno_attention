Dear Patriot,
The Jew, Larry Abraham, has launched an attack on Eustace Mullins with his "Insider Report". As you know, Abraham is one of the many Jews who have infiltrated the right wing and make their living off giving the "gullible goyim" their so-called economic and political advice.
In the 60's Abraham used as his front man Gary Allen, to worm his way into right wing ranks through the book, "None Dare Call It Conspiracy". Gary Allen was a great researcher and without a doubt wrote some of the best patriotic material in America at the time. However, over the years, Gary let the Jew,Larry Abraham, reap the profits from his labor.
When Gerald L.K. Smith in the 1960's ordered the book, "None Dare Call It Conspiracy", the Jew, Larry Abraham, intercepted the letter and wrote Smith,in abusive language, that "he did not want Smith's order for the book." Now, Abraham is back in action attacking Mr. Mullins as a "hatemonger".
The Jews are concerned over the popularity of Mr. Mullins and the large crowds he is attracting around the country and also because of the large number of people he is reaching through TV and radio interviews.
In July, Mr. Mullins was a key note speaker at our convention in Tampa, Florida. His new book, "The Curse Of Canaan" was quickly purchased by those attending.
In response to Larry Abraham's attack, Mr. Mullins has issued a special report entitled "None Dare Call Him Traitor:Larry Abra-ham/The Israeli Connection".
I wish that many more of our good supporters had been able to attend our meeting in Tampa. I believe we had some of the best and most interesting speakers of any patriotic meeting in America.
Mr. Walter Pearson gave an excellent talk on how patriots can sell stocks and legally give the money they would be paying in taxes to patriotic groups. Pastor John Fly gave a Biblical analysis
on world events. Pastor Craig De Mott (NCCC) gave two excellent lectures on health cures and the Bible.
Presidential candidate, David Duke, was on hand to give a rousing speech on the presidential campaign and how his efforts are reaching new people for the patriotic movement.
Mr. Mike Landis, who was organizer for the National States Rights Party in Illinois for many years and who is now the treasurer of AFPAC (Americans First Political Action Committee), gave a talk on organizing and how to communicate with new people.
One of the best speeches on the Convention was that of Ms.
Diedre Schoeman. Ms. Schoeman's great grandfather was one of the presidents of the Transvaal in South Africa and for many years her uncle, Johan Schoeman was the leading patriotic publisher in that country. She made two speeches at the Convention, one on the his-tory of South Africa and the other on the current political situation there.
Pastor Stanley Rittenhouse of the GANPAC (German American PAC) filled the audience in on his efforts to fight the phony "Holocaust” museum in Washington,DC.	\
For those who were unable to attend the Convention, we have a I set of 8 cassette tapes recorded from the meeting. These are available for $48. postpaid.
At the Convention, Ms. Schoeman brought to light the terrorism being used in South Africa by the Communists against black and white opponents of majority rule. Expanding on her talk, we have received an excellent video cassette on black terrorism in South Africa. The 30 minute movie is co-hosted by a German man and a black woman from South Africa. In this movie they show with documented film how the so-called black "Nationalists" in South Africa are in fact being trained and financed by the Communists and frequently speak at Communist meetings.
It also has footage of black terrorists burning alive blacks who are accused of supporting the White South African government. This is an excellent film for you to show to your friends and relatives to PROVE to them that the Communists are behind the effort to topple White rule in South Africa. This movie, "Year Of The Struggle" (30 minutes-VHS format) is available from us for $35.00 postpaid.
For those who contribute $25. or more this month, we have a written report by Dr. Coleman exposing the IRS terror tactics against American citizens and explaining in detail why the IRS is UNCONSTITUTIONAL and ILLEGAL. The report is entitled,
••IRS:Instrument Of Terror And Tyranny”.
And for those contributing $50. or more we have a special report by Mr. Eustace Mullins about Larry Abraham titled, "None Dare Call Him Traitor/Larry Abraham:Israeli Connection.”
Your help with our many projects is greatly appreciated. We hope to hear from you by return mail.
P.S. We need to reach as many new people as possible with the CDL REPORT. We have several thousand back issues (various issues) and we would like to see them distributed. We have weighed them and figured out the cost of mailing the different quantities. We will ship these to you for only the cost of the postage plus $1.00 for the mailing container. The prices are as follows:
25 copies--$6.00
50 copies--$9.00
