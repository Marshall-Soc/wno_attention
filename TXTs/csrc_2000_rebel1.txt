The Monthly Newsletter of the Confederate States Research Centre
Issue the First	August	A.D. 2000
New Pro-South Centre Opens in Downtown Wiggins, Mississippi
“Woe to them that devise iniquity, and work evil upon their beds! When the morning is light, they practise it, because it is in the power of their hand. And they covet fields, and take them by violence; and houses, and take them away: so they oppress a man and his house, even a man and his heritage ” (Mi-cah 2:2).
On the first of August, in the Year of Our Lord Jesus Christ, Two Thousand, the Confederate States Research Centre will open its doors to the good people of Stone county, Mississippi. The purpose of the Centre is to counter the ever-growing trend of defamation of ail things Southern by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (N.A.A.C.P.), the Nation of Islam (Black Muslims), “Rip* Daniels of WJZD Radio in Biloxi, and all other modem agitators for “political correctness.*' Southerners have a proud history
and heritage that is worthy of respect by all people, and yet Southern heroes are either ignored, or openly maligned in the public school system and in the mainstream media and entertainment industry, Southern history is rewritten and distorted to suit the latest agenda of the ruling elite, and Southern culture and religion is trampled underfoot by masses of social miscreants who have been brainwashed to hate what they do not understand. It is time for someone to stand up and say, “Enough is enough!” and the staff of the Confederate States Research Centre intends to do just that.
This unique Centre will feature a free Southern History Library which will include copies of rare and out-of-print Confederate and Copperhead books that the average public library would never dare to place on its shelves. Also free to the public will be the Lecture Room where continuous video or audio taped lectures on Southern history, Reformed theology, and related sub-
jects will be played throughout each week-day, and an occasional live lecture on the weekends (see printed schedule insert). In addition, we will have a wide selection of historical and theological materials for purchase as well as Southern bumper stickers, t-shirts, flags, and other memorabilia.
The Confederate States Research Centre is located at 155 East Pine Street in downtown Wiggins, Mississippi. Our hours will vary, so please consult the schedule or call (601) 928-2090. Please also visit our web page at www.freemississip-pi.org/educational. The Research Centre is a non-profit educational outreach and is associated with FreeMississippi.org, Donations to this work are welcome, but please note that they will not be tax-deductible. Catalogues and subscriptions to the monthly The Rebel Yell newsletter are free upon request. Deo Vindice!
1 whs bom, raised, and “educated" in Southern California. In the California public school system I was sustained on a steady diet of anti-South propaganda and revisionist history. I was taught that the Republicans, with “Ole Honest Abe” Lincoln at the helm, were responsible for “saving the Union” from those who sought to destroy it in order to perpetuate and extend Southern slavery. As do millions of patriotic American schoolchildren even year, I memorized the Gettysburg Address, listened with rapt attention to stories of the Underground Railroad, and thrilled to read of the military exploits of such Northern Generals as Ulysses S. Grant and William T. Sherman.
Influenced by a steady barrage of sixty second sound-bites on the evening news and the elaborate, yet fanciful. “reality” concocted by the movie-moguls in Hollywood, a Southern drawl would invoke instant images in my mind of sheet-clad imbeciles dancing around a burning cross, or some beer-bellied, tobacco-spitting “redneck” hurling racial slurs at “people of color.” The “Mason-Dixon Line” was to me an unscalable wall of separation between the socially sophisticated and open-minded North and the morally degenerate and bigoted South; it was a line I never wanted to cross.
However, about five years ago,
I had a “great awakening.” Everything that I had been taught about the South and the so-called “Civil War” of 1861-1865 — more accurately known as the War for Southern Independence — started to crumble as I began to read what the Southerners themselves had to say. All my life 1 had been told one side of the ftory — that of the victor. But don’t the “losers” have a story to tell as welt? Was the War really fought over the issue of slavery, as we have been told, or was it fought for other reasons?
it is estimated that only about six percent of Southerners at the outbreak of the war owned any slaves at
all, and an even smaller number were wealthy enough to afford the hundreds of laborers which are often associated with Southern agrarianism. It simply was not possible for the average Southern planter to pay $1,500 in cash (that was in gold, not inflated paper “money”) per slave; even those who could were frequently to be found picking cotton alongside their slaves. Despite the Northern Abolitionist accounts of merciless whippings and welted backs, of cruel masters and oppressed servants, such were in fact a rarity in the predominantly Christian South. In the late 1930s, the Works Project Administration of the Federal Government collected the testimonies of former slaves throughout the occupied South which are preserved in The Slave Narratives in the National Archives of Washington, D.C. The vast majority of those interviewed had fond memories of their masters and mistresses on Southern plantations. For example, Mary Rice, a former slave of Alabama, stated, “Slavery times wuz sho good times. We wuz fed an’ clothed an’ had nothin’ to worry about.” Tom Douglas, also from Alabama, reflecting on the “emancipation” brought about by the North, said, “I was happy all de time in slavery days, but dere ain’t much to git happy over now.” Gus Brown of Richmond, Virginia remembered his former master with these words: “I cannot forget old massa. He was good and kind.... I knows I will see him in heaven....”
It should be remembered that, while the foreign slave trade was outlawed by Congress in 1808, the domestic institution of slavery was protected by the “supreme law of the land” — the Constitution for the United States of America — and as such, all those who held public office in Washington D.C. were bound by oath to ensure its continued protection. Only a constitutional amendment, proposed by a two-thirds vote in Congress and ratified by three-fourths of the States could bring about
a lawful change in that document. Abraham Lincoln knew this to be true, and said so in his first inaugural speech on the steps of the Capitol: “I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the institution of slavery in the States where it exists. I believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so.”
In his speech at Peoria, Illinois on 16 October 1854, he revealed his true feelings toward the Black man by declaring, “Free them [the slaves] and make them politically and socially our equals? My own feelings will not admit of this.... We cannot make them equals.” In his reply to Stephen Douglas on 18 September 1858, scarcely five years before he issued his celebrated Emancipation Proclamation and altered the course of the war to an attack on Southern slavery as a calculated “war measure” to cripple the “enemy,” Lincoln stated:
“I will say... that I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of bringing about, in any way, a social and political equality of the White and Black races, that I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of making voters or jurors of Negroes, nor of qualifying them to hold office, nor to intermarry with White people.
“There is a physical difference between the White and Black races which I believe will forever forbid the two races living together in terms of social and political equality. And in so much as they cannot so live, while they do remain together, there must be the position of superior and inferior, and I,

as much as any other man, am in favor of having the superior position assigned to the White race/'
No White supremist in our own day has more clearly stated such views, and yet this was the opinion of the man who now sits enthroned in Washington D.C. as the very incarnation of the “American spirit" of freedom and equality and who is the hallowed patron saint of the Civil Rights movement
It is not widely known that the Southern State of Virginia was the very first political body in the entire world to enact legislation to end the slave trade. On 5 October 1778, the General Assembly passed “An act for preventing the further importation of slaves,” in which “any slave brought into the state contrary to the law would be then and forevermore free.” In keeping with such opposition to the wickedness of the slave trade, the Confederate States Constitution of 1861 permanently abolished the practice in Article 1, Section 9, Clause 1. Confederate President Jefferson Davis made clear his plans for the infant country when he stated, “The slave must be made fit for his freedom by education and discipline and thus be made unfit for slavery.”
It was Davis’ prediction that slavery “will eventually be lost”; it would outlive its usefulness and inevitably die a natural death. Although there were indeed some who believed that the natural condition of the Black man was servitude, the prevailing opinion in the South was in favor of gradual emancipation and even repatriation of the Blacks to their homeland. Many Southern leaders, such as General Robert Edward Lee, were wholly opposed to African slavery.

Let the Reader contrast such sentiments with the actions of the invading Northern forces. In a letter to General Grant, General John A. Logan reported that his men were “capturing negroes, with or with out their consent.... They are being conscripted.” In 1864, General Innis N. Palmer wrote to General B.F. Butler, “The negroes will not go voluntarily, so I am obliged to force them.” And at the same time Black men were being taken against their will into “service” to the United States, Yankee soldiers were “committing rapes on the negroes” and were “in the negro huts for weeks, debauching the females.” A war to free the slaves? Only a deluded mind would believe such nonsense.
What then would inspire the vast majority of non-slaveholding Confederates, many of whom were as young as fourteen years of age, to shoulder their muskets and charge with resolve into the very face of death? What gave these men the mental fortitude and courage to stand firm in their defiance of the mightiest war machine the world had seen up to that time? I firmly believe that the rag-tag “Rebels” were motivated by their love for their homeland, their families, and for their Christian roots. These men deserve to be honored for withstanding tremendous odds in an attempt to secure for future generations of Southerners the eternal “blessings of liberty.” In the words of one Confederate soldier, “I was a soldier in Virginia in the campaigns of Lee and Jackson, and I declare I never met a Southern soldier who had drawn his sword to perpetuate slavery.... What he had chiefly at heart was the preservation of the supreme and sacred right of self-government.”
Even the editors of the London Times acknowledged this to be true when they stated on 7 November 1861, “The contest is really for empire on the side of the North and for independence on that of the South....”
This “supreme and sacred right of self-government” is not based on the color of a man’s skin, but on the readiness of his soul to accept such a lofty responsibility. As such, self-government most assuredly would have been eventually enjoyed by the slaves of Dixie had the fanaticism and hatred of nineteenth-century Abolitionism not prevented her from implementing measures for a gradual emancipation which would honor both the property rights of Southern planters as well as humanly prepare the slaves for the duties which accompany freedom. Such a task did not require the shed blood of over half a million men and the anguish of countless grieving widows and mothers. Even the most noble ends do not justify violent and revolutionary means.
That is why this Yankee-born convert to the “Lost Cause” (it ain’t lost, by the way) feels his heart swell with pride and love for the Old South when he sees the Battle Flag floating majestically in the Mississippi breeze and sometimes even gets a lump in the throat when he hears the sweet strains of “Dixie.” My own ancestors “wore the blue,” but I now make my stand with the “boys in grey” and wait for the day when native Southerners will no longer be ashamed of their rich heritage and will join with those who are turning their backs on the siren song of modernity in order to return to the cherished principles of the past.

Northern Involvement in the African Slave Trade
This iniquitous traffick, beginning with the importation of negroes into Hispaniola in 1503, was first pursued by the English in 1562, under Sir John Hawkins, who sold a cargo at the same island that year. The colony of Virginia was planted in 1607. The first cargo of negroes, only twenty in number, arrived there in a Dutch vessel in 1620, and was bought by the colonists. All the commercial nations of Europe were soon implicated in the trade, but England became, on the whole, the leader in this trade, and was unrivaled by any, save her daughter, New England. The profit made by Englishmen upon the three millions carried to America before 1776, could not have been less than four hundred millions of dollars. The negroes cost the traders nothing but worthless trinkets, damaged fire-arms, and New England rum: they were usually paid for in hard money at the place of sale. The capital which now makes England the emporium of the world, was in large part bom of the African slave trade.
The share of the Colony of Virginia in the African slave trade was that of an unwilling recipient; never that of an active party. She had no ships engaged in any foreign trade. No vessel ever went from her ports, or was ever manned by her citizens, to engage in the slave trade; and while her govern-
ment can claim the high honour of having ever opposed the cruel traffick, her citizens have been precluded by Providence from the least participation in it.
The planting of the commercial States of North America began with the colony of Puritan Independents at Plymouth in 1620, which was subsequently enlarged into the State of Massachusetts. The first ship from America, which embarked in the African slave trade, was the Desire of Salem; and this was among the first vessels ever built in the colony. The promptitude with which the "Puritan Fathers" embarked in this business may be comprehended when it is stated that the Desire sailed upon her voyage in June, 1637. So it may be correctly said that the commerce of New England was bom of the slave trade; as its subsequent prosperity was largely founded upon it.
The trade of which the good ship Desire was the harbinger, grew into grand proportions; and for nearly two centuries poured a flood of wealth into New England, as well as no inconsiderable number of slaves. Meanwhile, the other maritime colonies of Rhode Island and Connecticut, followed the example of their elder sister emulously; and their commercial history is but a repetition of that of Massachusetts. The towns of Providence and New Haven became famous slave trading ports.
The present commercial and manufacturing wealth of New England is to be traced, even more than that of Old England, to the proceeds of the slave trade, and slave labour. The structure of New England wealth is cemented with the sweat and blood of Africans. In bright contrast with its guilty cupidity, stands the consistent action of Virginia, which, from its very foundation as a colony, always denounced and endeavoured to resist the trade. It is one of the strange freaks of history, that this commonwealth, which was guiltless in this thing, and which always presented a steady protest a-gainst the enormity, should become, in spite of herself, the home of the largest number of African slaves found within any of the States, and thus, should be held up by Abolitionists as the representative of the "sin of slaveholding"; while Massachusetts, which was, next to England, the pioneer and patroness of the slave trade, and chief criminal, has arrogated to herself the post of chief accuser of Virginia.
But one more fact remains: When the late Confederate Government adopted a constitution, although it was composed exclusively of slaveholding States, it voluntarily did what the United States has never done: it placed an absolute prohibition of the foreign slave trade in its organic law. — R.L.Dabney
