-Resident’s message....
Dr Michael Hill Monroe, Louisiana
Enemies
By the time you read this latest President’s Message, we should have completed our move back to Alabama. My family and 1 enjoyed the almost two years we spent among our fellow Christian Southern Patriots in Monroe, Louisiana. But the pull of home and family is strong. We chose to return to the northwest corner of the Heart of Dixie, near Florence, Muscle Shoals, and the beautiful Tennessee River. Sara and 1 solicit your prayers that this move will be good for us personally and for the League. Once we’re settled in, then we’ll send out the new mailing address for the League. Our toll-free number and our e-mail address will remain the same.
If we ever needed evidence that the current regime was bent on empire, we need look no further than its Middle East policy. Now that Iraq has been occupied and plans laid to distribute the booty among the supporters of the new imperial order, the regime’s attention has turned to yet another member of the Axis of Evil, Syria. Then who’s next?
Every generation or so the restless Yankee mind goes crazy, and, as a result, lots of people die and things are destroyed on a grand scale. I suppose this is what ‘shock and awe’ is all about. We have just witnessed ‘Operation Iraqi Freedom;’ in 1861 what was visited on the South, according to the same logic, could readily have been termed ‘Operation Southern Freedom.’ It’s all a piece of the same cloth. The objects of Yankee beneficence, then and now, can only be made free by invasion, occupation, and reconstruction. A good measure of fire and sword is, after all, for their (and our) own good. Those who resist the Lincolns, Shermans and Sheridans of history on the flimsy grounds that they are only ‘defending their country’ against a hostile invasion are . . . well, terrorists. 1 am reminded here of Sherman’s threats to punish the civilian population of Georgia during the March to the Sea if Joe Wheeler’s Confederate cavalry continued to resist Federal forces. But I suppose if you are God’s Chosen People and thus morally superior to everyone else, then you see it as your holy mission to remake the world over in your own image. Anyone who has the temerity to resist simply must be destroyed. ‘Mine eyes have seen the glory,’ don’t you know.
So, Yankees run amok on a fairly regular basis. No surprise here. But why do all those good Southern boys continue to fight to perpetuate the very empire that caused their ancestors so much grief and sorrow? As in all American wars. Southerners fight and die in numbers far out of proportion to their numbers in the overall population. At the same time, the northeastern Ivy League elite (the self-proclaimed ‘best and brightest’) waits to claim the spoils of victory bought by the blood of middle and lower class Southerners.
In the early years of the 20th century, several Irish patriots bemoaned the fact that Ireland’s sons were eager to fight for every country but their own. In
1
Southern Patriot
a similar vein, it is said of the Scots that the British Empire was built on their bones. When will Southern men see through all the appeals to false patriotism and leave the Yankee armed forces? How long will the blood of our young men be shed for the interests of an alien ruling class (and its foreign allies) that inhabits a much closer Axis of Evil—Washington, DC-Manhattan-Boston—and hates everything for which the traditional Christian South stands? It is past time that the Southern people understood that their natural patriotism has allowed them to be exploited by a ruling minority that has perverted these healthy impulses for their own sordid ends. Simply put, by being ‘patriotic’ and supporting the Yankee Empire, Southerners are contributing to their own eventual demise.
We Southerners need to do some serious thinking about where our loyalties ought to lie. Can we be both Southerners and Americans at the same time? Once upon a time, the two terms were virtually synonymous; most of what was good about America has its roots in the South. Southerners were THE Americans. But now the term ‘American* is being redefined so as to make it impossible for a Southerner to be an American unless he ceases to be a real Southerner. If you doubt me, try and express your Southern pride in Uncle Sam’s military today and see had far it gets you. Southerners, as Southerners, need not apply in any field.
We need to understand that there can be no polite and reasonable discussion with those who wish to use us up and then destroy us and all we hold dear. A sane man does not converse with his sworn enemy; on the contrary, he resists him. To expect to engage in
reasonable conversation with a man who intends to rape your wife, kidnap your children, and burn your house is in a fool’s game.
1 don’t think that the South’s enemies will ever understand our history, political philosophy, religious faith, or cultural peculiarities. Moreover, I really don’t care if they do. Our attempt to justify the South in their eyes is like casting pearls before swine. They don’t care how sublime we consider the South to be. They just want to destroy it, and only power can check power, as the great Calhoun reminded us.
Therefore, there cannot, and should not, be any thought of compromise with those people. They mean us no good at all. To those Southerners who wish to beg for a place at the table (a table, by the way, that our white Southern ancestors owned) in order that we might negotiate for the crumbs that fall from Jesse Jackson’s plate, we in the League of the South say to you: ‘Depart from us. You are not our compatriots.’ To those who long for the South to be given a fair shake along with every other culture that has implanted itself upon these shores, we say: ‘We dare defend OUR rights!* And to those who think that the white, European, Christian civilisation that has been given us by the grace and mercy of God and manifested through generations of honourable and courageous ancestors is not worth a fight, then we join our Scottish ancestors in saying: ‘No one wounds me with impunity.’ May God give us boldness in all our endeavours.

ALABAMA
Morris Dis-Ease thwarted: The Alabama LS Annual Meeting took place in at the state capitol building in the archives room on 8 March. The SPLC (which has been presenting programs to Lions Clubs and other groups slandering the LS as a ‘hate group’) had tried to get the League thrown out, but Dick Brewbaker, the state representative (and not a League member) who had sponsored the League refused to back down. The 100 attendees heard speeches by Michael Hill and Franklin Sanders, as well as a new song by Larry Smith of Basic Gray, a hilarious punch at the SPLC, called ‘Morris Disease.’ Minister Cecil Williamson of Selma reenacted a speech by Alabama's William Lowndes Yancey, whose portrait overlooked the room.

LETTERS
To the Patriot:
Here's the text of a letter I routinely send to the Republican party when I get fund raising letters from them.
The GOP is fond of calling itself ‘the party of Lincoln’ (i.e. Mr Jack Kemp). However, a fair and honest reading of history reveals that the 16th president was a usurper of unconstitutional powers, a dictator, a war criminal, a racist and an accomplished liar. You don’t believe it? Read: The Real Lincoln by Thomas Di Lorenzo and When In the Course of Human Events by Charles Adams.
Lincoln destroyed the legitimate and duly constituted republic of the Confederate States of America. He also, along with the Republican controlled Congress, totally destroyed the principles and ideals of limited federal government as embodied in the US Constitution. Lincoln’s unconstitutional, illegal and immoral war against the Southern states cost all of the American people 620,000 dead and many more thousands maimed for life. He deliberately, and with malice and hatred, made total war upon the Southern civilian population (est. 50,000 dead), their property and their economy. He thereby caused untold misery and suffering among the men, women and children of the Southern states that lasted for generations. Yes, he ‘saved the Union’ by the brute force of arms. He governed without the ‘consent’ of the Southern people and many tens of thousands in the North. He, and his radical and despotic Republican allies, had nothing but utter contempt for life, liberty, justice, peace and the Constitution. He was the
law unto himself - a dictator.
Our modern day Federal government, which is thoroughly immoral, corrupt, greedy, power-hungry, tyrannical, globally imperialistic and unconstitutional, owes its entire existence to Lincoln and the Republican Party. Lincoln, and his Republican allies, by destroying the principles and ideals of limited federal government, pointed the way to our present day welfare-warfare-police state.
As a result of Lincoln’s infamous legacy (federal power without limit), modern day Republicans (socialists) and Democrats (Marxists) have done everything they possibly could to turn America into a hellish nightmare at home and a ruthless global empire abroad. And, thanks to the ignorance, apathy and plain stupidity of many American citizens, they have succeeded beyond their wildest dreams. With each passing year, America becomes more atheistic, materialistic, hedonistic, socialistic, brutal and despotic. An economy that groans under the weight of draconian federal taxes, a national debt approaching seven trillion dollars, forty million state-sanctioned abortions (murders), uncontrolled illegal immigration, public schools that are godless socialist hellholes, war after endless war - when, dear God, will it all end? Are Americans really a ‘free’ people anymore? Is our ‘liberty’ just an illusion? You know the answer. We have kissed real freedom, real liberty and real property rights goodbye forever. Say hello to the ‘New World Order’ comrade.
No sir, the GOP’s Mr Lincoln was no great patriot or statesman and he sure as hell was no saint. There should be no ‘Greco-Roman temple’ in
4
Washington dedicated to the worship and honour of this psychopathic monster. The truth is this: he was nothing more than a power-hungry brutal tyrant, a war criminal and an unrepentant murderer. I’m sure that the GOP’s Mr Lincoln, at this very moment, is rotting in hell along with the likes of Stalin, Grant, Hitler, Sherman, Pol Pot, Sheridan, and every other demonic butcher that ever crawled out of Satan’s sewer.
I’m ashamed to admit that I was once ‘a registered Republican’. That was before I learned the truth. I’m still a Republican, but I will never again vote Republican.
The South and her people must rise again. She must finally rid herself of northern oppression. She must rid herself of the immoral, wealthy and extremely powerful Northeast ruling oligarchy. She must rid herself of the ruthless New York central banking families and their power-hungry minions at the CFR. She must rededicate herself to principles of virtuous, restrained and limited government. She must return again to the old and true ideals of life, liberty and the honest pursuit of happiness. And, most importantly, she must always honour and obey the infallible teachings of our Lord Jesus Christ. Then, when these things are done, she will once again be able to lift her ‘starry-crossed’ banner high and she will finally take her due and honourable place among the truly free and great nations of history.
A proud, unbowed and unreconstructed Southerner,
Henry A. Clemens

Ignored History: Socialist Support for ‘Honest Abe’
by Al Benson Jr.
Several years ago a friend gave me an article from the Communist newspaper Daily World. The article was about one Joseph Weydemeyer, a Communist friend of Karl Marx. The article told about how Weydemeyer had been, among other things, a union organiser and officer in the Union army during the Civil War. My first thought was ‘What was this Communist doing in the Union army?’ A few years later I chanced to read another article mentioning the names of three or four other European socialists that had fled Europe and ended up as generals in the Union army. Having been concerned about early socialist influence in this country I felt I should try to check on this to see if there was more. There was.
I went to the local public library and got a list of all the generals in the Union armies during the ‘late unpleasantness.’ 1 checked off all those with foreign-sounding names and started looking them up in books containing biographical sketches and in encyclopaedias. Many were bom in the United States, but quite a few came from Europe and I found several that had taken part in the 1848 socialist revolts in Europe. After those revolts failed, a goodly number of these men came to the United States and when the War of Northern Aggression began they joined the Union army. Many ended up being generals, colonels, and
captains in the Union army. Since these men, almost to a man, joined the ranks of the Union army and supported Lincoln they must have seen something in Lincoln’s agenda that they, as socialists and Communists, could identify with.
Karl Marx, who had been a correspondent for utopian socialist Horace Greeley’s newspaper, was strongly desirous of a Union victory, as were his friend Friedrich Engels and the Russian revolutionary Bakunin. These are little facts the history books never mention. Should you wonder why socialists and Communists would choose to back Lincoln, socialist historian James McPherson has written in Abraham Lincoln and the Second American Revolution that: ‘Lincoln championed the leaders of the European revolutions of 1848; in turn, a man who knew something about those revolutions—Karl Marx—praised Lincoln in 1865 as
“the single-minded son of the working class” who had led his country “through the matchless struggle for the rescue of an enchained race and the reconstruction of a social world”.’ I doubt if we would be too far off the mark in deducing from this that Mr Lincoln had an affinity for socialism. He and Marx almost seemed to have a mutual admiration society going between them.
When the war started, the United States army was small, probably not much over 15,000 men, and in the beginning days, many of the best officers resigned and joined the Confederacy to help defend their states. Thus the Union army had rather a pressing need for military officers with prior experience. In this context, Friedrich Engels made a most revealing statement. He said: ‘Had it not been for the experienced soldiers who had entered America after the European revolution—especially from

Germany—the organisation of the Union army would have taken still longer than it did.’ In other words, according to Engels, the initial backbone of the Union army at the war’s outset, was the socialist/ communist cadre from Europe. Let that thought sink in a bit. With that in mind, is it any wonder that the North fought the type of war that it did—a total war not only on soldiers, but also on their families and property? To most of these socialists the concept of private property was anathema. It should, in their minds, all belong to the state, and what didn’t belong, they set out to destroy.
The names of some of these European socialists you have probably heard or seen if you’ve read much about the war. There were Franz Sigel, Carl Schurz—who later went on to become Secretary of the Interior in the Grant administration, and August (von) Willich, who openly lectured his men on the glories of socialism, and there was Albin Schoepf, a Hungarian socialist who became commandant of Fort Delaware prison camp. There were enough socialists who ended up with high military rank in the Union armies that space does not permit me to name them all here.
William Burton, in his book Melting Pot Soldiers has observed that: ‘At least eighteen Forty-Eighter colonels conmianded German regiments at one time or another, and many other regimental officers came from the politicized generation. Another six or seven Forty-Eighter colonels commanded nonethnic regiments ... but from a group of three to four thousand men a truly remarkable number served the Union cause in important military capacities.’
From an Internet publication ‘Forty-Eighters in the Union Armies' the following quote was taken: ‘the failure of their revolutionary hopes in Europe did not prevent them from taking arms again in 1861 to defend the very principles they had fought for in 1848 and 1849: Union, freedom, and democracy. Many of them made a conscious connection between the two wars.’ In other words, the European socialists and Communists saw, in. what Lincoln was doing, a furtherance of the socialist goals they fought for in Europe in 1848. We might well question why our ‘history’ books almost totally ignore this.

Verbal Independence
LESSON NINE
CAPITAL: SOUTH, SOUTHERNER AND SOUTHERN
by James Everett Kibler
The great centralist wisdom of the compilers of the Chicago Manual of Style (by which writers, publishers, copy-editors, and scholars determine ‘standard’ usage) is that South, Southerner and Southern should be written south, southerner and southern. Such a choice to lower-case these words no doubt has behind it the implicit belief that the South is merely a direction on the compass in this United-We-Stand One-Nation-Indivisible. The Chicago Manual of Style has thus become for usage what Noah Webster was in the nineteenth century in standardising American spelling and vocabulary to the bland Northern norm. If wrongheaded in the practice to lowercase southern and southerner, the Manual is at least consistent in its choice also to lower-case north, northern and northerner. We can take some small consolation from the fact that at least this error in thinking is not compounded with the usual obligatory biased double standard.
It has just recently dawned on me that so engrained is the centralist way of thinking in all of us, that even some of our best Southern thinkers and most devoted Southern devolutionists also use the lower case spelling! We do so from habit without realising that when we do so, we are tacitly accepting the line of centralist thinking. Thus, one of the most essential changes we need to make in our orthography fj one we must make immediately 3A is to capitalise these South-derived words. In so doing, we counter the centralist mind-
set that has become ingrained in us all. Think about the logic (illogic) of it. Most of us Southern Nationalists have come to learn to capitalise the South as we do America; but unlike American, following the lead of the Chicago Manual of Style we still write southern and southerner. This, dear friends, must change!
Because the South is more than a compass direction, it stands to reason that its derivative words must show it by their capitalisation. We Southerners have the sense that we are a people, and a nation in the true Biblical sense of the word. I often call us the nation without a government. So it is totally appropriate to capitalize Southerners as we do Irishman, Swede, or Norwegian. Our adjective Southern should be the capitalised counterpart of Irish or English or Swedish. Who has ever seen the lower-cased swede and Swedish, or english and englishman? How peculiar these spellings would look! That we accept the lower-case southern and southerner as a given without thinking proves the pervasiveness of centralist thinking.
The capitalisation of South, Southern, and Southerner is therefore of first importance, and not just to show our high regard for the South. The act has as well social, philosophical, and political import. By capitalising these words, we signify that the South is indeed more than just a region. This capitalisation is the mark of secession. When we capitalise these words we have already recognised the South as its own nation and have seceded on the page. Perhaps that is the primary reason, after all, for the centralist’s lower-casing it.
Verbal independence is a step toward political independence. It is a much bigger step than we might realise.
8
Think of how many times we have tacitly agreed to the centralist way of thinking — agreed to it each time we lower-cased South, Southerner, Southern. Not everyone can have the talent or time to run for office, edit periodicals, teach courses, write books, articles, and the like, but we can all instantly change our habit of spelling these two words. It is a seemingly small matter, but of the most essential nature and greatest import.
In publishing books with two university presses I was told by their copy-editors that my use of capital South, Southern, Southerner, North, Northern, Northerner did not comply with the Chicago Manual of Style, which publishers use as their authority on usage. My reply was that I knew the copy-editors were accurate in this and that all publishers complied, but that I still preferred to keep my capital letters for South, Southern, and Southerner. I would, however, out of a spirit of compromise, agree to lower-case north, northern, and northerner. I reasoned that if northerners in that northern compass point of the United-We-Stand One-Nation-Indivisible that created the Chicago Manual of Style, did not feel they were separate and distinct, I would honour their right to think so. Indeed, if they did not feel distinct, then they were not, and it would be accurate to lower-case them. But under no circumstances should South, Southern, and Southerner be lower-cased. We in the South feel we are a distinct people. Both copy-editors honoured my wishes with South, Southern, and Southerner, but insisted that for consistency’s sake North, Northern, Northerner also be used. ‘Fine,’ I said, and so it was done.
Perhaps this matter of capitalisation may be a very small technical point to
many, but we devolutionists will no doubt immediately grasp what a crucial point it is, and how important it can be to the Southern movement. Please, then, good Southerners remember to capitalise South and our words derived from South. It is happening more and more widely today. I hope we will soon start seeing even more results of this effort everywhere about us. And when we do, we’ll know we are making even greater strides toward our goal of independence.

Voices of the South
A Gift from Dixie Outfitters
There have been many calls for the Southern groups to unite and present an effective counter-offensive to the onslaught of political correctness, revisionist history and racist hype that is spewed forth daily in the news media.
We must have a pro-active public relations campaign that will constantly inform the public of our views and issues. To this end, Dixie Outfitters offers to the Southern heritage community a gift. This gift is a professional public relations campaign, staffed by a professional media expert of the highest quality. It is my hope and plan that after this first year, this gift will be a self-perpetuating and self-sustaining effort. This gift is named ‘Voices of the South.’
‘Voices of the South’ is a new public relation campaign headed by Dave Henderson. Dave Henderson is a public relations expert with 35 years experience in public affairs. He is former
executive director of the Virginia Jay-cees, appointed by President Nixon to the Cost of Living Council, a former Washington lobbyist for Pan American Airlines and others. His other clients have included General William C. Westmoreland. The NY Times, in a front-page story during the Westmoreland v. CBS trial credited him with the first major public rela-tions/legal case. Today, both law schools and schools of journalism use that case in their curriculum.
Dave Henderson and Voices of the South need effective speakers willing to give of their time to tell the world about our noble heritage. We are seeking individuals who will be willing to become the voices for Southern Heritage. Categories of speakers that would be desirable include historians, legal scholars, humorists, leaders of heritage groups, writers, teachers, professors, medical doctors, retirees with unique communications skills and others with the ability to enlighten and entertain aud-iences. Those audiences would include broadcast as well as live assemblies, newspaper interviews, and other engagements based on available talent. It would be highly desirable to have Americans from all races and religions as participants. We need speakers from all parts of the country so that no matter where the opportunity arises, we will have a qualified spokesman available. We need many speakers so that the task of telling our story will not fall to heavily on any one speaker. Dave’s task will be to locate the right media outlet and schedule the correct speaker for that event.
Those interested in becoming a part of Voices of the South, we urge you to contact us at:
Voices of the South, David W. Henderson, 6313 Gormley Place, Springfield, Virginia 22152 or by E-mail dhender999@aol.com.

Please include a brief biography, address, phone number and E-mail address. Include samples of writing if appropriate. If you are unable to participate, but know of someone you believe could be an effective spokesman or woman, please put him or her in touch with us.
Who'll Free Our Southern Land? by Linda Lee
I sit here with a smile
and watch the tightening rope;
I watch Iraqi people, jubilant with hope.
I think of dear ole Richmond, with the tryant sitting tall and know I'll never see the day, the yankee god will fall.
But hope is with the grandkids and children just now bom; that one day in their lifetime, one sunny Dixie mom, that 2 or 3 will gather there and more will come around, and rope be slipped around his neck and he be tumbled down.
Then jubliant with freedom, we'll see his great demise; and thru the dust of tryants our flag will quickly rise.
Let's have our ropes at ready, sledgehammers, keep on hand; for who but us will liberate and free our Southron land?
Gods and Generals: Hollywood’s Black Sheep
by JeffS. Gibson
When Dr. Hill asked me to write a movie review for the Southern Patriot, 1 was taken back a little yet honoured and excited to do so. Great timing was on my side because it was my turn to see Gods and Generals the very next day. What a perfect place to start.
As a lover of movies, I grow increasingly frustrated with the shallow, depressing filth that Hollywood puts out each year and dares to call it entertainment. I knew Gods and Generals would not be the same.
1 went with my son Taylor on a Sunday afternoon and observed a few things before the movie started. The crowd size was bigger than I expected (the theatre was nearly 3/4 full) and I was amazed to see more elderly people than usual. One gentleman showed up wearing a Confederate Kepi. There were no blacks in the audience, though I live in a county with a black majority.
The reviews were almost ALL horrible. One national critic, Roger Ebert, said it was a movie Trent Lott and Strom Thurmond would love and wasn’t worth seeing. Thank you Roger for your unbiased, objective critique.
Although I am not a big fan of Steven Spielberg, when he released Schindler’s List, it was quite an experience. Viewers got sucked into the holocaust experience, and there were calls from Spielberg and his pundits that the movie should be mandatory viewing for all high school students. Never mind that it had sex scenes, nudity and the F word and yet, here we have Gods and Generals, the most accurate movie made about the war for Southern independence
EVER, and do you think there will even be a hint of it being 'mandatory' viewing for our high school students? Forget about the fact that it more directly affects us all. Forget about the fact that its truthfulness and accuracy is above most movies we see about history (a lot of the scenes were written using the own words of the people depicted). Forget about the fact that it lacks excessive gore, violence, nudity and profanity. But educators, politicians, and the like remain silent.
When the movie finally started and the flags started to fly across the screen, I had no doubt that we were in for something special. Director Ron Maxwell is gifted at depicting battle scenes in a watchable, very understandable way, as opposed to the mess of battle scenes in a movie like Glory where endless soldiers die horrible deaths and we are unable to ascertain who is doing what.
The acting is Oscar caliber with Stephen Lang giving the performance of a lifetime. After watching him portray Stonewall Jackson, one will be hard pressed to picture the real Stonewall when he is mentioned. Lang also portrayed Pickett in Gettysburg but the role was much smaller. Jackson is shown to be a God-fearing man, a man of duty, honour, loyalty and passion, a portrayal I believe to be very accurate. Robert Duvall gives us a General Lee that seems very authentic, a man of convictions and a man of God. A man loyal to Virginia. Not the plastic, hazy Lee we saw in Gettysburg played by Martin Sheen. Even Mira Sorvino as Chamberlain’s wife tugs at your heart strings while tearfully reading her husband a poem.
I only saw one nugget of political correctness in the movie (to my surprise because director Maxwell

Obituary
Gladys Gilliand
Many of us had the pleasure of meeting Mrs Gladys Gilliand over the past couple of years. She was in attendance at the grand opening of the League Building in Abbeville, and a frequent visitor to the Building since that time.
The Lord called Mrs Gilliand, 102 years of age, home on 6 Feb. 2003. She is the mother-in-law of Keith Todd, Abbeville SCLoS, and a True Daughter of a Confederate soldier.
The funeral service was held at New Hope Presbyterian Church in Abbeville. Mrs Gilliand was interned in Elmwood Cemetery, Birmingham, Ala., next to her departed husband.

hates PC) when Chamberlain tells his brother not to call Negroes 'darkies'. It seemed a little too 'current'.
This production has a look and a feel all its own and an authenticity that has to be seen to be appreciated. ALL unreconstructed Southrons should take their families to experience this event because it is not just a movie, it’s as close as you’ll ever come to being there. I for one cant wait for its release on DVD where it will be restored to it’s original 6 hour length.
Men weep, God is invoked, soldiers die, men act like men and women act like women, husbands act like husbands and wives act like wives and we laugh, cry, cheer and are angered. What more could you ask for?
