AT THE CENTER OFTHE ARC By Howard B. Rand
The Eastern Question In the year 1896, nearly a hundred years ago, Lieutenant C.A.L. Totten, graduate of West Point, and later Professor at Yale University, published his views concerning the eventual military drive Russia would make into the Middle East. Lieutenant Totten based his findings upon his study of the messages of the prophets of the Lord found in the Scriptures and his research was aided by his own background of military training, enabling him to point out the strategy to be employed. He wrote in part:
"Whatever be the lines of operation in the practical solution of the Eastern Question - - its objective point is Jerusalem. . .For Europe and Asia, at least, the solution involves the ultimate supremacy of some one power or people, and the query is: How does the balance swing, towards the Slav or Saxonr To state the Eastern Question in its simplest form is to ask: Who shall control the destiny of Asia? Or, since the one involves the other: Who is to be the final arbiter in the destiny of the entire Eastern Hemisphere?
"It was in this light that both Peter the Great and Napoleon viewed it. But to put the question as broadly as possible, it may be couched in better terms as follows: Who, among the nations, shall be ultimately dominant?. . .Viewing all Russia as an army disposed for an advance southwards, it is thus seen to be heavily reinforced at its right center, with its left and right wings somewhat defused. . .At times the balance of agitation swings from east to west, as at the present moment, then back again, but never does Russia suffer the pendujum to come to rest upon the center of the arc; nor will she, until ready to detach it and give gravity its chance to act in an unexpected manner. . .
"By constantly fomenting the uneasiness either of Europe or Asia, at the extremities o? her position, Russia has adroitly withdrawn attention from her powerful central place of arms. Whatever may be here intentions east or west, she is too secure to fear disturbance at the point most vital to all her deeply-laid and ambitious plans.
"Lying midway between Merv and Odessa, where we would locate the widely-extended paws of the Russian monster, we shall term this Trans-Caucasus region the head of the Bear, and cannot but view it as the main point of interest in all of its future movements. . .Who shall say that, following the floods of some near Spring, the Russian overflow shall not seek warmer lands, through these same passes, confident that, if they are gained - -gates that are guarded now so poorlyl - - all other lands which Muscovites desire must also ultimately fall to them."
The Swinging Pendulum If it were not for the fact that the above-quoted statements by ** Lieutenant Totten were written so long ago, one might think them to be a report on present-day news events. In the past the pendulum has been swinging from east to west, and from west to east. Now, having come to rest at the center of the arc, the Kremlin gave the order for the invasion of Afghanistan. Russia’s hovering presence in Asia foreshadows moves in the central area *A the Middle East with the expectation of being able to sever the petroleum jugular vein of the West and extend Soviet influence southward to dominate the sea lanes and gain control of the mineral wealth of Africa. More than a year ago, the Special Office Brief (published in lingland) released a partial timetable of planned Russian goals:
This picture, published in 1896 A.D., by Lieut. C.A.L.Totten places the Russian Bear's paw over Afghanistan and Persia (Iran) with head and right paw menacing Turkey.'
"Russia is known to be planning a new offensive in the Middle East. Our precise and categorical information is that Russia plans to have totally taken over all South Africa, all of the Middle East and Western Europe by January 8-9, 1984. . .Detente is designed only to encourage us to sleep."
Notice particularly the date, January 8-9, 1984, which the Soviets have selected for the completion of their foreplanned military aggression. It is very interesting to find that, in the booklet entitled Vistas of Revelation, by William O. Lay. Jr., January 7-8, 1984 was established as the date of the Second Junction, when the prior removal of the displacement of God’s covenant people from the Divine will, according to Great Pyramid chronology, will eventuate in national renewal through extreme tribulation.
The First Junction Date was August 5, 1964, on which the Tonkin Bay incident occurred in the Vietnam war. It focussed attention upon the nation’s failure to measure up to its responsibilities and move forward toward its foreordained destiny. May 13, 1980 is 40 x 144 days after August 5, 1964 and 1335 days before the Second Junction Date. Mr. Lay states that the time cycles centering upon the Second Junction Date "point to the final fruition of the Divine plan to regenerate the earth through direct intervention.’’
Have the Kremlin despots selected, for the implementation of their diabolically-conceived program of aggression, the very date that will finalize their ignominious defeat in accordance with the prophecies in the Book of Ezekiel (chapters 38 & 39)? Obviously, the days of the year 1980 are fraught with momentous potentialities.
It In Neiu*
gglmise the main weapons being employed have been economic rather than military up to this time, few are aware of the inception of World War 111. In fact, in his news column in the Manchester (N.H.) Union Leader for January 11, 1980, Jeffrey . Hart observed:
'World War III is well underway. Only we don't realize it because it doesn’t resemble in any way the first two world wars of the 20th century. The Soviet goal is not to seize Paris or bomb Pearl Harbor, but to cut the West off from its vital oil supplies (also from mineral supplies as well)."
Now that the Kremlin masters have resorted to military action to implement their Final program, the nations are rapidly approaching the fulfillment of the declaration by the Prophet Zephaniah (Zeph. 1:14): "The great day of the Lord is near, it is near, and hasteth greatly, even the voice (sound) of the day of the Lord.

COMMENTS & ADDITIONS:
“AT THE CENTER OF THE ARC” by Eldon Purvis
May 13. 1980 shows up in the article by Howard Rand and I would like to reconstruct some thoughts for you to pray about. First, I will go back to August 1964, the first date he mentions. I was moving into the realm of the Baptism of the Holy Spirit and many changes, plus upheavals hit me, as well as my family. It was a coming-out time from the religious system and into a new beginning with home Bible study meetings, seminars on the gifts of the Holy Spirit, trips to Palestine, Jamaica and England plus other ministries that were started that eventually became part of the Charismatic movement of today. Then, a few years later in 1975, after a complete turn-around about Israel and the Jews, I moved my family from Florida to North Carolina where the New Beginnings and Educational ministry started into full swing.
Now, I want to have a look at some events that took place in 1978 which will show some interesting dates. On August 6, 1978, "FEAST OF TRANSFIGURATION", Pope Paul 6th died. Then Pope John Paul 1st was appointed in a lightning decision and the Cardinals of the Roman Catholic Church said the reason he was selected in one day was because it was the Holy Spirit who called him. . .1 wonder, as he only lasted 33Vi days and his death still has a big question mark that will remain. On September 28 and 29, 1978, "THE HOLY DAY (Anglican-Episcopal) SAINT MICHAEL & ALL ANGEL’S DAY", Pope John Paul 1st died. The Book of Enoch states, "Michael, one of the Holy Angels, to wit, he that is set OVER THE BEST PART OF MANKIND AND OVER CHAOS. Read Daniel 10:13-21 and Daniel 12:1 follows: "At that moment Michael shall appear, Michael the great captain, who stands guard over your fellow-countrymen; and there will be a time of distress such as has never been since they became a nation (Israel) till that moment. But at that moment your PEOPLE will be DELIVERED (or will escape) every one who is written in the book; many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth WILL WAKE, some to EVERLASTING LIFE and some to the reproach of eternal abhorrence". PRAISE YAHWEH.
On October 16, 1978, "FEAST OF TABERNACLES", Pope John Paul 2nd was appointed. This was at the end of special days from October 2, 1978, "FEAST OF TRUMPETS", the Messiah’s birthdate. Do you suppose Yahweh has a timetable and some signs for His sons, the wise and watchmen? Certainly.
Now we come to 1979, the Jubilee Year just passed. On June 3, 1979. PENTECOST SUNDAY* (Holy Spirit visitation; Acts) my brother-in-law and associate of over 36 years died suddenly with cancer of the blood. Harvey was 56 years old. (Look up 7 times 8 which equals 56 - see explanation later). His tombstone bears Harvey Edward Strub, ‘SON OF YAHWEH’ ’’. The stone cutter made all kinds of errors before he removed the old stone and replaced it as above. The enemy didn’t want that testimony in that cemetery. The next important date in 1979 was October 3, "DAY OF ATONEMENT" when Pope John Paul 2nd was speaking at the United Nations in New York and on the same day
2 a good friend of ours died, age 27 (3x3x3) the cube of three. Before we go further, I quote Jude 9: "In contrast, when the archangel Michael was in debate with the devil, disputing the possession of Moses’ body, he did not presume to condemn him in insulting words, (or charge him with blasphemy) but said, ‘May Yahweh rebuke you!’ ’’. Revelation 12:7 says "Then wa» broke out in heaven. Michael and his angels waged war upon the DRAGON, the dragon and his angels fought, but they had not the strength to win, and no foothold was left them in heaven. So the great dragon was thrown down, that serpent of old that led the whole world astray, whose name is Satan or the Devil -thrown down to the earth, and his angels with him". Two beautiful friends had left on Pentecost and the Day of Atonement. In the January 1980 issue of New Beginnings. Norene Nicholls wrote about The Day of Atonement: On October 3, 1979, ten days after the fall September 23rd equinox, was the Day of Atonement which is also the time when the Jubilee Trumpet sounds. Five days later would be the 8th of October and would be the beginning of the Feast of Tabernacles, which runs then for seven days. Then on the 8th day there is a solemn assembly. As we entered into this fall period of time we came into it with the Feast of Trumpets or the sounding of the trumpets. When God begins to do a thing there is always a counterfeit which takes place. In other words, we have the counterfeit threefold this year. If you watched your TV you were cognizant of three definite priesthoods which came to the fore with the sounding of the trumpets. Here came the Pope and they sounded the trumpets for him. Here was the Roman Catholic priesthood. About the same time the Dalai Lama from the East was in this country and they sounded the trumpets for him. Here is your Eastern priesthood. About that same time the Mormon people were in conference in Salt Lake City and what is atop their temple? Moroni blowing the trumpet! You had three priesthoods. The Mormon priesthood, the Eastern priesthood and the Catholic priesthood all sounding trumpets about the same time. Under the cover or under the camouflage of all of this God was doing a great thing. He was sounding a spiritual trumpet that only the ears of those that are opened would hear. . .And what is He doing? He, too, is bringing forth a priesthood but this priesthood is not the Catholic, not the Dalai Lama, not the Mormon priesthoods. He is bringing forth and initiating the manifestation of the Melchizedek priesthood. These things that have happened externally are but symbolic of what is truly taking place in the spiritual realm. Is it not written, first the natural or soul realm but we are looking to the spiritual realm where the true priesthood is coming forth. I tell you saints, it is an important time. But you say, ‘I don’t see any outward manifestation’. No, you may not see that outward manifestation as yet but the outward manifestation will come in due time. The thing has been initiated! It has begun! We have begun a new time! We have entered a new period, a new* dimension, a new-unfolding of the purpose and the plan of God. Keep your eyes open, keep your hearts open. Watch, .listen, .be alert, .awake and recognize the things that are taking place in the hour in which we live.	(end	of	quote)
Mr. Rand also mentioned May 13, 1980 but 1 want to start with May 12, "ASCENSION DAY". This is 40 days after the Resurrection April 3, 1980. Dr. Bullinger, in his book, "Number in Scripture", has this to say about Forty, both in years and days. Page 266-267:

SHORT HISTORY LESSON THE ONION JACK AND THE BRITISH COMMONWEALTH By Gilbert C. Saddler, Cape Province, South Africa
We read in the prophecies by Isaiah: "And he shall set up an ensign for the nations, and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth" (Isaiah 11:12).
This is one of the many instances in which prophecy clearly differentiates between the Houses of Israel and Judah, despite theology’s refusal to accept and teach this.
The ensign covering this great assembly of people is well known as the "Union Jack." The "outcasts of Israel," as referred to by Isaiah, are clearly seen in the British Commonwealth of Nations, United States of America and kindred nations.
Whence came this ensign, which was to be set up for the nations?
When 'God made His first Covenant with Noah, after destroying by flood the wicked life existent in the world, He gave to Noah the assurance that never again would the destruction of the world take place by flood. It was then that God unfurled the first “ensign" in the heavens, the brilliantly coloured rainbow, which was set in the sky as a sign of security to the dwellers on earth.
It is most amazing how many know nothing of this God-given sign of the rainbow, which was to be the outward and visible sign of the Covenant between God and Noah for future generations. The Scripture reference is Genesis 9:11-17.
Ever since that time man has devised different types of banners and flags to represent distinctive peoples and their - interests. In ancient times paintings, carvings and draperies of different colours were acknowledged as being representative of h nations. At a later date banners were used, which for more spectacular purposes were hoisted on poles and carried. It was only in the Middle Ages that fluttering symbols - - like flags - -appeared, and they were mostly religious emblems. Such emblems were carried by the early Christians with the "Cross of Calvary" upon them, and history records such emblems being used in England.
This appears to have been the origin of the flag of England. It was at the time of King Richard I of England, about the period A.D. 1189, when the "Cross of Calvary” was carried as the English flag, representative of the patron saint of England - - St. George. This flag consisted of a red cross on a white background and is preserved as the flag of the Red Cross Society the world over. During the Crusades the Crusaders wore it on their breasts to correspond with the emblem of the Cross.
When in A.D. 1603 James VI of Scotland became James I of fcyEagiand, he brought in the national flag of Scotland, known as St. Andrew’s Cross, represented by a diagonal cross of white on a blue background. In A.D. 1606 these two flags were put together as the national flag of England and Scotland. It was then called the “Union Jack" and remained so for about two hundred years in history.
It was under this flag that the growth of the Empire began and Britain added India, Canada and Gibraltar to its possessions. It is claimed by some to have been "Jack" out of respect for King James, but is it a coincidence that James, in Hebrew, is Jacob of whom we claim to be descendants?
When Jacob (Israel) our forefather was blessing his grandsons Ephraim and Manasseh he said: "let my name be named on . them" (Genesis 48:16), and later the new name given to Jacob • • which was Israel - - was applied to the ten-tribed kingdom of Israel, (I Kings 12:24).
'I he name Jacob - - or Jack - - has since been attached to the flag of the descendants of Ephraim-Britain and, in accordance
11
with prophecy, Jacob’s descendants have "grown Into a multitude in the midst of the earth," and they have become the "nation and a company of nations."
In the reign of George III, about A.D. 1801, Ireland was added, and the Irish national flag of St. Patrick, a red diagonal cross on a white background, blended the three crosses into the Union Jack as we know it today.
Thus the three symbols of these Christian countries were combined with the red "Cross of Calvary" in the centre of the Union Jack. This flag stands for liberty, equality and justice (as near as man will ever be able to get this) the world over. It floats over 2,000 isles of the seas, covers a third of the earth, flies in the seven seas, and is the emblem of half the number of ships in the world. It represents the most important flag on earth, so what other emblem would you like to suggest to replace it as the ensign that is to be set up for the regathering of Israel and Judah?
What do these three crosses of the Union Jack signify?
The red on white Cross of St. George of England is the Christian Cross of Calvary, the Cross of the New Testament, emblematical of Jesus Christ. The white diagonal Cross of St. Andrew of Scotland is the Old Testament Cross, the Cross of Jacob, which he made when blessing his grandsons. The red diagonal Cross of St. Patrick unites the other two, and the triple unification of these flags is surely a reminder to us of the "Holy Trinity” - - the Three in One.
Twice we have the diagonal cross, significant of the multiplication sign, on the Scottish and Irish flags, and on the English "Cross of St. George” we have the plus cross.
In the Psalms we read: "Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee, that it may be displayed because of the truth” (Psalm 60:4). May this not be the symbol of truth? Is this not the banner referred to as now used by British-Israel?
The colours of the Union Jack - - red, white and blue - - are of much more significance than is generally thought. Exodus 25:4 tells us that two of these colours constituted the curtains of the Tabernacle in Israel.
Red signifies "judgment,” and reminds us of the life laid down for us by the Son of God on the Cross. The "Cross of Calvary” speaks not only to us of death, but rather more of the resurrection. White is the symbol of "purity" or holiness, while blue is the colour of the heavens, signifying "love”.
Wherever this symbol of freedom flies it has bred into a liberty-loving people a marvellous spirit of sacrifice, which has been one of the basic foundations upon which the British Empire has been built.
It stands for the spirit of truth, the love of fair play, equal rights - - which can be improved upon - - the love of children and the protection of home life, for righteousness and freedom of all peoples, and to the glory of God.
We do not claim that the Union Jack clinches the case as to the British people being Israel, but we do ask you in all seriousness: Can you point to any other "ensign" under which has been accomplished all those things in history which were to be accomplished by the Israel people?
All the unconditional Covenant promises which were made to the forefathers have been, and are being, most definitely fulfilled in the people living under this symbol of freedom. Is this nothing but coincidence?
The Israel people used as the symbol of measurement the "inch": the British and other kindred people do likewise. The rest of the world uses the metric system.
The Royal Arms of Britain bear the motto "Dieu et Mon Droit” - - “God and My Right." What right does it refer to? The Covenant promises made to our forefathers were the “Israel birthright" - - the right of the Israel people whose heritage and destiny it is as a "servant nation" to spread the Gospel of the Kingdom.
The ancient heraldic symbol of Judah, the tribe through which the “sceptre," or kingship, was to descend, was the lion, the Lion of Judah. The heraldic symbol of the tribe of Ephraim was the wild ox or unicorn. This "Lion and Unicorn” constitute the heraldic symbol of Great Britain.
| the critics can do, it is a fact that the word Hebrew words. “Berith” meaning .’liitd “ish" meaning "man,” thus "Berith-ish” has "British” * - means "Covenant man” or "the man
^ f§9 ** ^
tie covenant,” i.e., a descendant of the Covenant fathers. I *T7ie ancient languages of Ireland (Erse), of Scotland (Gaelic) and of Wales (Cymric) are considered by the best of students to have been based on Hebrew, whilst the English language retains between 4,000 and 5,000 Hebrew root words, yet for centuries we have swallowed the propaganda of Rome that we owe everything to Latin, which is all part and parcel of the Papal propaganda.
Leading historians, such as Professor Huxley, are agreed that our ancestors came from Assyria and the Crimea, to which parts Israel was carried into captivity. Many works give the historical outline as to Israel's migrations from the Black Sea and Caspian Sea area. One line of migration was across the Kertch peninsula to Arsareth in Rumania, which the second Book of Esdras confirms.
That line of migration involved hundreds of years as they wandered across Europe to the north-western coastline of Europe, from where, at the appointed time, the invasions of ancient Britain began, not as different peoples, as usually taught, but as different sections of one and the same people - -Israel.
If we examine the monuments, inscriptions, archaeological discoveries, etc. (waymarks, as they are called) more than sufficient proof can be produced showing that the Anglo-Saxon-Celtic people are the people of Israel today. Go back a thousand years to the old laws of the Angles under Alfred the Great, A.D. 900, and we find this recorded: “Be ye kind unto strangers for such were ye in the land of Egypt.” It is evident that he knew who we were!
The Bible is the recorded word of Almighty God. It covers the Divine plan for the restoration of the world to the laws of God, as provided for our earthly governance, which, in our stark ignorance, we have neglected. The central figure of this Divine plan is Christ, and the connecting link between God and mankind is a chosen servant nation called Israel.
When famine in the land of Canaan drove Jacob and his family into Egypt they numbered but seventy people. When Moses led the “Children of Israel" out of Egypt they were as a multitude, which Psalm 114 confirms thus: “When Israel went out of Egypt. . .Judah was his sanctuary, and Israel his dominion."
“Judah was his sanctuary." It was, and the work of the “sanctuary" was completed when, at the crucifixion of Christ, the Tempe veil was split from top to bottom and destroyed. (Please note that if it had been an earthquake it would have split from bottom to top, but the Scriptures say it was split from top to bottom - - in other words, the destruction came from above, from the hand of God.)
"And Israel his dominion." The promises of the “birthright,” or dominion, were to continue with the seed of Ephraim and Manasseh. After the reign of Solomon, Israel became two Kingdoms, Judah and Benjamin forming the Southern Kingdom, “the Sanctuary Kingdom," with their capital at Jerusalem under Rehoboam, and the remaining ten tribes becoming the Northern Kingdom, “the Dominion Kingdom," with their capital at Samaria under Jeroboam.
The “Dominion Family" under various invasions, were carried away into captivity in Assyria. The “Sanctuary Family" went into captivity in Babylon under Nebuchadnezzar. After seventy years it was the descendants of a portion of this latter family, who became known as the Jews, and who were responsible for the crucifixion of the Messiah.
Do not make the mistake of looking for the fulfilment of those prophecies which were to be fulfilled in the “dominion people" under the history of the “sanctuary people," or vice versa, for that is exactly what so many have done and missed the point. The story of the Bible outlines that Jesus Christ was to be the
12 central Person around whom all this programme is to revolv First, He came as the High Priest and Redeemer to tf "sanctuary,” and they rejected Him. Secondly, He will come t the King to rule over His "dominion.” This remains to b fulfilled. His coming is the only solution to the chaotic state i which the world exists today. Surely we do not think an man-made scheme is going to solve the colossal problems whicl confront humanity?
Be quite sure of one thing: Jesus Christ is still to return anc reign over "Israel his dominion”!
When the great reunification and restoration of all Israel takes place under His reign, and, in my opinion, it is near at hand, then shall we understand the meaning of the name "Israel,” which means "ruling with God,” which is undoubtedly the theme of the Bible and the positive heritage and destiny of the Anglo-Saxon-Celtic peoples.
Israel is the great Empire over which flies as the symbol of Truth that imperishable flag, the Union Jack, under which banner of freedom you and I have the proud heritage and privilege to dwell, and under which - - by God’s Divine guidance - - may we worthily and righteously discharge our duty to God and our fellow-man in spreading the Gospel of the Kingdom unto all nations.

ALL THINGS CONSIDERED:
December 30, 1979 - - or OOPS - - 1983?
(From National Public Radio)
If you found an 1980 calendar or a date book in your Christmas stocking, well throw it out. It’s already obsolete. A long time ago, it turns out, long before calendars were built into digital wrist watches, somebody made a mistake. Consequently, ‘All Things Considered Commentator’, Father Andrew Greely, explains that next year is not 1980. Next year is actually 1984. ^ We’re almost half-way through the decade. A thousand years or ™ so ago, when they decided to up-date the Julian calendar and count time, not from the founding of Rome, but from the coming of Jesus, the Monk, who was given charge of the project, made a mistake, not the first churchman who had a hard time counting.
He lost five years somewhere. So Jesus was already four or five years old in the year One AD or to be more precise, it was already Four AD. In the year the inept young Monk called One AD figure it out, it’s really 1983 already. Time does Fly! Next year is 1984 and you fans of George Orwell should keep an eye open for big brother. He may just talk with a southern accent.
The point of all this is that a decade is an utterly artificial measure imposed on the passage of time. When we talk of the 60’s as being a bad decade, we really mean, I think, the time between the assassination of John Kennedy and the pardoning of Richard Nixon, 1963 - 1973. A ten year period like that may make some sense just as might a ten year period from the election of Dwight Eisenhower to the first inauguration of Lyndon Johnson. Such a posterioride divisions of time are of some help but there is no reason to think that anyone can make any sense at all out of artificial turning points like the beginning of new calendar decades or new centuries or even new millenia, as far as that goes. They are convenient marks on a sheet of paper and not necessarily convenient analytic categories. Talk about the era of the 70’s or the ‘Me’ decade if you are Author Tom Wolff and the era of the 80’s is so much baloney. It doesn’t do any harm, of course, and I’d be the last one to deny journalists the opportunity to write stories or tape programs which enable them to be able to take vacations after Christmas. I just want to make sure that no one takes the ponderous Global generalizations about the 80’s we hear these days, including my own, very seriously. So, from^^ Chicago, where the problem is big sister and not big brother, thi^ is Andrew Greely wishing you a very Happy 1984.
