Dear!	»
This is my final appeal to raise the funds necessary to publish the exciting and ambitious new edition of Mv Awakening.
I have done all I can, but Mv Awakening will cost a whopping $60,000 to publish. We are still $25,000 dollars short of the funds we need to publish the new edition. That is $25,000 dollars in addition to our normal operating expenses for Davidduke.com and EURO.
Mv Awakening has become the most important book in the entire world in the effort to awaken our people for our heritage and freedom, a struggle that determines whether our race lives or dies.
Without your generous help it may take many months to get Mv Awakening back in print
Some might ask why I must ask for funds for the new edition. The reason is because past sales of the book have gone directly into the fight, not into a fat bank account Mv Awakening has not only awakened people all over the world, it is a main source of funding for our work.
In addition, we have, at our cost, put thousands of copies in the hands of influential people. We and our supporters have put copies in many libraries and institutions. We have given or sold many copies at inexpensive bulk rates for distribution in key industries, educational institutions, political bodies and put it in the hands of renowned European Americans of cultural or scientific fame. One of these efforts led to an international furor. A year after we provided a copy to the President of Iran, he became the first major world leader to openly question aspects of the Holocaust story. Later, he sponsored the historic international conference on the issue in Tehran, where I was one of the major speakers. Let/s create some more breakthroughs with this powerful book.
Right now, many people around the world are crying for the new edition, but we have not been able to raise the funds to print this ambitiously large, 750 page new edition. Printing and paper costs have gone up considerably. We have been delayed for three months. We cannot afford any more delay, as people are waiting for it all over America and the world. The truth must get out!
If you can make a generous gift on this matter, I will do whatever I will my part to get the book in print. I will even borrow the balance needed from credit cards if I must But I must raise at least $25,000 in the next two weeks. Also, in this issue of the Duke Report be sure to read "In Defense of the Jena Six," and my story on the "two Galileos" who have told the racial truth.
I Sincerely Thank You for Your Support! — David Duke
Gift^^^OO^SOO, $1000 or even $5000 or even $10,000 are needed to get Mv Awakening back in print Mr. Andrews, please let me hear from you!
This is it: The final appeal for the new Edition of My Awakening
My friends, this is it. I am so frustrated and disappointed. II have just about given up on the idea of raising the money wef need for the updated edition of My Awakening.
We have made a little progress but, we still need $25,000 in addition to our normal operating funds for the new, 2007 edition of My Awakening, a book twice as large as Jewish Supremacism.
I have finished with many new updates and additions, but the printer can't print it
until we raise the necessary funds! I have been trying for four months to raise the funds. This my last try!
White Nationalists have found My Awakening more effective than any other book in the world to wake up their friends and family. It has become the core book for our cause the world over. Now,
