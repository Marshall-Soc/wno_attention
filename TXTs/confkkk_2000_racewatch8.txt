Howard Bobbitt
As a White American, we don't need anymore talk on Race,
d AND WE SHOULDN'T LISTEN TO ANYMORE TALK FROM THE ANTI-WHIT E * LIBERALS. WE NEED MEANINGFUL ACTION NOW. ACTION THAT WILL SEGREGATE THE RACES.
Other races living among the White Race retards White Racial progress. This is why the races should be separated and
IS THE ONLY TRUE SALVATION TO AMERICA'S RACE PROBLEM.
( Dixie, The Confederate States of America - should be made a I White Nation. Blacks and other races should claim some of the Northern States for their homelands.
Geographical separation of the races is the only meaningful solution to the race problem. I I

Read This Closely - Jews Boast of Control of
Democratic Party
Jewish Week of January 24 carried this amazing admission about theifi control over the Democratic Party. Note carefully the following points!
1.	Jewish leaders celebrated Clinton’s election as a “Jewish victorjl
2.	Jews have emerged as a power both “inside and outside” the polj system.
3.	Jewish Political Power” has been built up over three decades.
4.	For the first time in history a President has named six Jews to Cabinet and two on the Supreme Court.
5.	Jewish political power is a “Democratic phenomenon.” Eizenstat said
that, “many of the gains (Jewish political power) will remainfl matter who occupies the White House.”

VIOLENCE NO. 1 SCHOOL PROBLEM
Despite statistics pointing to a slight decrease in the Nation's overall crime rate, adults see fighting, violence and gangs as the biggest problem confronting public schools, a Gallup poll said on August 25.
The solution favored by 86 percent of those polled was stronger penalties for student possession of weapons.
"For all the hoopla in the national press, there is no crime wave in America -- except among blacks," said a report by Phi Delta Kappa, a professional fraternity for educators, which commissioned the 26th annual poll from Gallup.
Murder rates for whites actually decreased between 1968 and 1994, it said, citing Federal statistics, but "the rate among blacks increased by 65 percent."
As a reflection of that, 31 percent of nonwhites voted fighting, violence and gangs as the biggest problem in public schools. That category and "lack of discipline" shared top billing as concerns of 18 percent of all the 1,326 adults surveyed by Gallup.
The public blames the increase in public school violence on factors over which schools have little control: use of drugs and alcohol, growth of youth gangs, breakdown of the family, schools lacking the right	of disciplinary
authority they once had, and increased portrayal of violence in the media.
Blame also was placed, but by fewer people, on the inability of school staff members to deal with troubled students in the regular classroom instead of special classes.
keep those shekels rolling in folks, there's no business like shoah business.
TOP IIQNIST SPILLS THE BEANS
"Jews end Justice" - by Edgar M. Bronfman
Talk - Wednesdays October 21st, 1998, Schara Tzedeck Synagogue, Vancouver,
B.C., Canada.
Program description: Edgar Bronfman is President of the World Jewish Congress, Chairman of the International Board of Governors of Hillel, and Chairman of Seagram Company Ltd. He is one of the architects of a $1.25 Billion settlement with Swiss banks and other institutions throughout Europe that were depositories of Jewish wealth during the 1939-'45 period and whose owners perished in the Holocaust. He works to preserve and foster the worldwide unity of the Jewish people.
Good evening: I first arranged to meet the President of the Swiss Bankers Association 3 years ago representing Holocaust survivor's claims. The Swiss did an audit and claimed there were 744 unclaimed accounts totaling 38 million Swiss Franks ($32 mil. U.S.). We asked them to verify those figures and to determine how many hidden dormant accounts there were. .However they *
stalled for banks hold money and have no reason to search for owners and give it back. They asked us to trust them, but we demanded verify - verify! !
Switzerland turned back 30,000 Jews at the German border after the war started, and acted callously towards many of it's own Jews. It's said the Swiss prolonged the war for 2 years as they used plundered German gold to buy tungsten, nickel, and other armaments metals needed by the Germans. In those 2 years 10 to 15 million people died. We are not blaming today's Swiss for their father's and grandfather's guilt, but we demand justice.
After 5 months of inaction they needed pressure, so I arranged a private luncheon meeting with Hillary Clinton in the penthouse of a New York hotel. Immediately afterwards the President asked Stu Eisenstatt to open all U.S. files which then affected the Swiss proceedings.
A year later I told the banks I knew they were spending $.5 Billion a year conducting an audit and handling their public relations, and it would be better to settle now than continue spending this money. We Jews continued to take the moral high ground giving them reasons to change their attitude but not forcing them.
Three years from my first Swiss meeting the banks settled a class action
suit for $1.5 Billion, not $1.25 as reported. We could have received more
but we couldn't prove how much the banks owed.

Today I'm told many Swiss are mad at the 15,000 Swiss Jews and are saying unpleasant things to them. We must remember Jews don't create anti-Semitism but rather anti-Semites look for an excuse; and in Switzerland we gave them an excuse. But if 15,000 Jews have to undergo a few temporary hardships so the world's 15 million Jews can obtain justice, so be it.
We are now examining Insurance companies in France, Holland, Belgium, Sweden, and South America for well over $1 Billion.
Like other European countries Sweden transported Jews to be killed and took their land and homes, so returning Jews will now be given the full value of their land in today's prices. Norway is setting up a Holocaust fund for it's survivors. Austrian, German, and other banks are also establishing funds.
It has never been a question of money, but to set the record straight so in the future there will be no question of what happened and noone can deny the Holocaust's existence.
