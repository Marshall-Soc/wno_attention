September 2004 Dear Christian Friend:
i
Earlier this year when we ran our front page article about the Book of Esther several wrote us because they believe that the Book of Esther is part of the Old Testament, even though it does not mention God and has nothing to do with religion.
To our surprise on August 2nd there was a special on the Dead Sea Scrolls on the History Channel.
The narrator said that the whole of the Old Testament has been found on Dead Sea Scrolls, EXCEPT for the Book of Esther!
Also, reading the National Jewish Post & Opinion we happened upon an interesting article on the late President Richard Nixon. The article stated that during the Yom Kippur War, President Nixon was dead drunk and couldn’t even answer the telephone! Of course, the Jew Henry Kissinger and his friend Gen. Alexander Haig were on hand and when it looked like the Egyptians were going to defeat Israel, Kissinger authorized an airlift to Israel of tanks, ammunition and whatever they needed to tip the balance of the war in their favor. It was a great fortune for the Jews that Nixon was dead drunk and out of action.
A number of military officers have sprung up through the ranks in very short periods of time when they have served the interests of the Jews. In World War I, Lt. Col. William S. Graves was tapped by the Bolsheviks in the War Department to be appointed to be the Commander of the American Expeditionary Army in Siberia. Graves was rapidly promoted from Lt. Col. (1917) to major general. (1918) Before World War II Dwight Eisenhower was a major (also temporary Lt. Colonel) on the staff of General Douglas Macarthur (1933). When WW II started Eisenhower was promoted from major to a five star general in about four years because he served the interests of the half Jew Franklin Roosevelt. It took him 22 years to get promoted to Lt. Colonel! Woodrow Wilson and his Marxist aide Col. Edward Mandel House paved the way for Graves to lead the uAmerican” forces in Siberia. The first step in the rise of Graves was when Gen. Hugh L. Scott the Chief of the General Staff was forced to retire in 1917. Gen. Tasker Bliss was appointed as Chief of the General Staff. Three months later pro-Bolshevik Gen. Peyton March was named to replace Bliss.
The way had been paved for the meteoric rise of Gen. Graves to be put in place.
It seems that Graves was part of a military cabal in the War Department who were international Marxists who were in symphony with, and ideologically aligned with the Jews and their racial brothers who overthrew the Russian Government. The story of Graves, Col. Edward M. House, Woodrow Wilson, General Peyton March, Secretary of War Newton D. Baker General Kernan, and other conspirators is amazing.
One of the leading officers with the British contingent in Siberia who was trying to help the White Russians was Colonel John Ward. (Member of Parliament) Ward in his book WITH THE DIE HARDS IN SIBERIA goes into detail on how General Graves undermined the Allied efforts to get military equipment to the White Russians so they could fight the Reds. In his book Ward said: “Out of sixty laison officers and translators, over fifty were Russian Jews.” In his book AMERICA’S SIBERIAN ADVENTURE. Graves braggs about attacking the Whites as “anti-Semites” and how he threatened to hang the editor of a White Russian newspaper if he continued to expose that the majority of the “American” officers in Siberia were Jewish and of their support for the Bolsheviks. The British had sent approximately 1 billion dollars worth of weapons and supplies to the Allied Forces in Siberia to be given to the White anti-Bolshevik Russians. The equipment was guarded by troops commanded by General Graves. Graves refused to turn the weapons and equipment over to the White Russians, eventually causing their downfall. When the Japanese, (Gen. Oil) British (Gen. Alfred Knox) and French (Gen. Janin) generals wanted the equipment to be given to the White forces, Graves prepared the “American” forces to fire on
them if necessary. Col. Ward noted that General Graves had a large group of “intelligence officers” brought to Siberia who were recruited from American ivy league universities. Col. Ward said that out of those brought to Siberia the majority were Jews. Ward also complained that the majority of the troops with the “American” Expeditionary Force were also Jewish.
Outside of Leon Trotsky, Graves was probably the man most responsible for the anti-Christian Bolsheviks winning the “civil war” over the White Russians. We can “thank” Graves and his “American” Jew soldiers for making possible the murder of millions of Christian non-Jews in the Russia.
Some of our good friends have written about the work we are doing on JEWISH RITUAL MURDER by Julius Streicher. We have finished the English translation and it is on easy to read 8 1/2X11 pages. It contains a several page biography of Mr. Streicher, his imprisonment, torture and hanging by the Jew controlled Allied forces in Germany.
We're working on a number of great reports and documents which we need to get to you. We are working as fast as we can with very limited funds. Those who want to and care about out work could if they wanted from time to time send large to help us along with our projects.
Please think about helping patriotic groups while you are still here in this earthly plain so you can see the results of your sacrifices. Those who help us with a contribution this month will receive a copy of the large manuscript JEWISH RITUAL MURDER by Julius Streicher. We will only publish enough copies for those who contribute towards our work and no more.
Thank you for your continued support for this work.
Sincerely,
James X. 'Warner
