Dear ANF Members and Supporters;
In lieu of the quarterly report by the American National
isc
Federation we will be holding a public meeting to bring everybody up to date and look at our first year in review. We have some important news so by all means come and show your support. The ANF Reports will be published AFTER this meeting. Here are the particulars:
*	We will meet on Saturday, November 5, 1988 at 1:30 pm at the Harbins Community Center in Dacula, GA. A map is enclosed with this notice. If you need further directions you can call the ANF at (404) 962-6738. We will man the phones until 1:00 pm on Nov. 5.
I As usual, the rules are simple at the Community Center: 1) No Smoking in the building 2) No drugs or alcoholic beverages allowed 3) No cursing, no discussion of illegal activity, and no threatening
language allowed. 4) Since this meeting is not intended as a public______________I
function, we of the A.N.F. would appreciate it if everybody dressed casual so as not to draw unecessary attention to our meeting. We just want to create a relaxed atmosphere so that we can discuss the past, present, and future of the movement.
*	This meeting is important. It will be the last meeting before the new year and we must develop our strategy now because the A.N.F. has some hot issues going. If you have any news, views, etc. to share, come early so that the staff can work you into the program.
See you on Nov. 5,
The American Nationalist Federation Staff
P.S. We're using the Kingdom Ministry logo on the envelopes to insure your privacy.
