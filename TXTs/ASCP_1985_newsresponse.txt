The Rev. Bruce Edwards is no longer bitter. And he has almost forgotten the emotional turmoil.
But Edwards, former pastor of the Plains Baptist Church, remembers well the circumstances that thrust him into the nation’s spotlight eight years ago.
Edwards, then pastor of the small rural church in newly elected President Jimmy Carter’s hometown, gained the nation’s attention in 1977 for his stance against a policy that barred blacks from joining the church.
The Rev. Clennon King, a black activist minister from Albany, was denied membership at (he church where Carter had worshiped before his inauguration.
Edwards, staunchly Insisting on an open-membership policy, tried to persuade church members to withdraw a 1965 church policy barring blacks.
He subsequently was criticized for his handling of the King incident, given a vote of “no confidence’’ by cbnrcb members, and forced to resign as pastor in 1977.
Carter, who was close to Edwards, was also angered by the membership policy, and ultimately played a role in the church’s lifting the ban.
“I’ve put it behind me,” said Edwards about that period of.his life. He is now pastor of the Ma-
kakilo Baptist Church on Oahu Island in Hawaii, aoout 25 miles northwest of Honolulu.
Edwards accepted the pastor-
ate of the Hawaii church in 1977, telling reporters that he would write a book about his experiences in Plains. The book, tentatively ti-
completion in 1981. Edwards declined to comment on the nature of the legal problems.
The 38-year-old Jacksonville, Fla., native told reporters when he left Plains eight years ago that he wanted to pastor at a church where be could build a ministry. In a telephone interview last week, Edwards said he has been doing just that.
“We had about 70 members when I came here,” be said. “Now, we have 204.
“I feel like I am accomplishing a lot here,’’ Edwards added. ‘Tve got a good group of people here, and everything seems to be going along well."
He is active in the Hawaii Baptist Convention and is chairman of the convention’s Committee on Committees and Board Nominations. “And,” he said, ‘Tve recently taken up photography and learned a lot about that.”
Edwards said be has returned to Plains several times and is looking forward to returning to the mainland when his work in Hawaii is completed. “I’m not at all bitter,” he said. “At one time I was, but I’ve gotten over that I have a lot to look forward to.”
He is pleased that reporters now call him only “very, very rarely,” Edwards said. “All that publicity added to (my family’s) problems,” he said.

SOME PREACHERS TELL THE CONGREGATION:"WE ARE NOT LIVING UNDER THE OLD
’ TESTAMENT LAWS. WE ARE LIVING UNDER "GRACE" AND THE NEW TESTAMENT LAWS."
THEY ARE IN ERROR: READ JOHN 5:39,46,47. YOU LEARN THAT JESUS TELLS THE PEOPLE
TO "SEARCH THE SCRIPTURES" THEREFORE,JESUS COULD ONLY BE REFERING TO THE OLD TESTAMENT,AS THE NEW TESTAMENT HAD NOT BEEN WRITTEN.	---
