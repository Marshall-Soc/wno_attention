The "race from hell" is almost over. It looks like a Black radical will become the next President of the United States. If ever there was a wake-up call for White Americans, this is it!
Even if McCain wins, there is absolutely no relief for our people. Mr. Amnesty, John McCain, has bent over backwards to support Martin Luther King, affirmative action racial discrimination against White people, the 700 billion criminal bailout of the Jewish Wall Street international bankers, and of course, the endless wars for Israel that have cost us so much blood and American wealth.
There is little we can do to affect the outcome of this election decided over the next few days. No Third Party candidate has any real chance, and that is exactly how the masters of America arranged it.
But, we can do something about it! We can assemble four days after the election at our International European American Conference in Memphis, Tennessee on November 8 and 9, and announce to the world that European Americans will no longer sit idle while our rights and heritage are destroyed.
Even if Obama wins, he will not come close to a majority of the White vote in America. More importantly, his election will motivate tens of millions of Americans to support our Movement. They will finally realize that we have lost the America of our forefathers and that unless we stand up now, our children will have no future in the nation our people created. Obama's election will radicalize millions of White Americans. If a Black Marxist who pals around with communist terrorists, and who stays for 20 years in a viciously anti-White church — becomes President, it will become crystal clear to European Americans that we must stand up for our heritage, rights and interests just as Africans, Mexicans and Jews support their perceived interests!
The economic disaster we have long predicted is also now at hand. It is predicated on the two issues that the Duke Report and the Truth at Last concentrate on. The subprime crisis came about by giving racial minorities millions of loans they didn't deserve, all of which will now be paid by hard-working White taxpayers. The robbery of the Jewish-dominated Federal Reserve and Wall Street Bankers compounded the problem while the controlled media covered it up. We must speak out on these issues!
Join me and speakers from America and the world at Memphis, Tennessee on Nov. 8 and 9. Time is short so please act quickly, send in the accompanying form and/ or call my office to reserve your place. If time constraints keep you from coming, please take a moment to make a contribution to help make this costly event a complete success.

If you help us significantly I will be glad to send you a conference DVD and give you access to the event video archived on the Internet.

Sincerely, Dr. David Duke
