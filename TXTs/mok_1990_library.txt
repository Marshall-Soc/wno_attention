Legacy Library
We are stepping up the process of distributing information on the fundamental subject of fasting and prayer. Also available - other important data concerning our Christian Heritage.
Many of the forgotten American and English classics which we have collected over several years are now available. The articles, sermons and books date as far back as the early 1600s. These works are inspiring, challenging and uplifting.
It is our prayer that the material we make available will be studied by Christian researchers, young and old alike, to rise up one united Christian people, under one God, in one nation with Faith, Liberty and Justice. To fulfill our destiny under God and take dominion over airrie earth. (Gen. 1:26)
"The eyes of the Lord preserve knowledge; and He overthroweth the words of the transgressor."
(Piov. 22:12)

THEABSENCEOF CHRIST, THE REASON FOR FASTING - James Miles 1858 In a sermon-•That which we sow in weakness, shall be raised in strength. From our sincere but houseless worship there shall spring splendid temples to record God's goodness; from the simplicity of our social union there shall arise wise and politic constitutions of government, full of the liberty which we ourselves bring and breath; from our zeal for learning, institutions shall spring which shall scatter the light of knowledge throughout the land, and in time paying back where they have borrowed, shall contribute their part to the great aggregate of human knowledge; and our decendents, through all generations shall look on this spot and to this hour with unabated affection and regard *
After traveling the country and spending countless hours
in old book stores, public libraries, universities and flee markets, looking for what made Colonial Christian America great, we were awed by what we found.
With God's help we have been led to a wealth of knowledge and information about our forefather's teaching and belief which shaped America.
Their way of life caught the attention of the world.
We at the "Mission of the King" began to speak and publish a newsletter, "The Missing Key". We will continue this method of teaching the powerful subject of fasting and prayer as taught by our founding fathers. This Christian duty has been neglected far too long.
We dedicate this library] and our endeavors to terminating the slaugh-ter of our babes through j aborticide. The Chris-1 bans of America cannot allow this atrocfy to continue. We must educate oursehes, unite and take a stand against what is evil,
It is impossible to share all the significant information we have collected through a monthly newsletter alone. We have been blessed with thousands of old books, sermons and newspaper articles dating back to the early sixteen hundreds. Werea!^* ize there are many truth seekers,^ scholars, home schoolers, Christian educators and preachers who do not have the time, resources or funds to pursue such an endeavor. Therefore, we are proud to announce the new addition to this ministry. The "Christian Legacy Library".
This library is unique because it is an opportunity to make our library your library. As we sift through these old classics we will make what is the choicest and most pertinent material available to you at the lowest prices possible. If you are having trouble obtaining a particular American title or author prior to 1812 we may be able to help.
