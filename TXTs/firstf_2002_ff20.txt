SURGEON GENERAL’S WARNING: First-time readers of alternate news, especially boob tube babies, may experience severe loss of confidence in the Establishment press and tube.
Speech and religion were already ours back when FDR named “four freedoms.” But he would whip hunger, fear and oppression, abstaining forever from Europe’s wars.

This article first appeared in our October 1999 issue. The founder of Mobile^ March Against Crime always urged us to keep a vigilant eye on those public custodians.
By Lillian Jackson
Government at all levels gets bigger and more totalitarian; conversely, liberty shrinks.
We no longer have representative government. Those we elect represent their own interests, succumbing to backroom drummers or powerful political action groups. The man on the street is forgotten.
What is the right of referendum?
It is a mechanism whereby the people may initiate enactment of a law or ordinance or the right to vote on an issue by getting a petition signed by a specified number of registered voters. The number required is usually 5 — 10% of the number who voted in the last general election in the city, county or state wherein the petition is being circulated.
The petition is then presented to the legislative body to which it is addressed (city council, county commission or state legislature), which body is then required to either pass the ordinance, law or resolution, or, failing to do so, put the matter to a public vote known as a “referendum."
Hence the people enjoy the continuous right of franchise rather than a trip to the polls every four or six years. Having real opportunity of input on issues encourages political responsiveness and reduces public apathy. Better government is the result.
Where is this right in effect?
Currently 23 states have this act, which translates into hundreds and hundreds of cities and counties within those states. The opponents of referenda point to California

Not much is heard about referenda in the other 22 states, where they serve as tools for accountability and responsibility.
Where is the opposition to this right?
The opposition will come from those in power and those who want to control our government bodies via the back door, as has been done for years. When you hear a protest against it, you know their power is being stepped on. No one wants to relinquish power, but the voters must be
By Olaf Childress One of the Alabama Coalition’s directors has correctly noted the futility of trying to replace that entire herd up on Goat Hill in next month’s election, saying we ought to target the 35-member state senate and save those 105 “representatives” for later. Not that there’s a noticeable difference between either legislative chamber, or the two wings of the Republocrat Party. But thinning out those senate misfits should prove the less daunting task.
No bill becomes law without clearing both houses, which explains this strategy. The beauty of it is that you don’t need to be in any of the organizations affiliated with the Alabama Coalition in order to do your duty.

Alabama Moratorium
One day without taxes, some say, although a laudable thought |_ must remain but a fantastical dream. Am I so naive, they ask, as to think that the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are still reserved to the States respectively, or to the people? How do we get the liberal news channels, sine qua non, to admit this is happening?
Is the mediacracy actually so important? Have you forgotten the counsel that if the right eye offends, to pluck it out? Then why not a blatantly leftist press and PCTV? In recent times while we who love freedom quite beyond the New World orderly’s understanding have largely coordinated our resistance via the internet, the latter grows calcified and redundant. (Somebody tell their advertisers.) We will see better, much more clearly, having shunned and condemned that coterie cooing among themselves for ever more taxes - to fund their fantasies; among which, no progress sine such birds may be the most laughable.
Around mid-April, 2003, our entire labors no longer go to Leviathan. And if Copperhead Yankees don’t understand why Alabama’s Tax Freedom Day comes earlier than theirs, it’s because of less state and local taxes. Few may participate this first time around, having not gotten the word, others thinking to wait and see. Can’t blame them; caution is a good thing. We have often seen truth and honest endeavor undermined by sneaky types covertly pushing in the opposite direction.
But, shall the smaller risk of carefully conceived action now, before our chains are finally welded, be avoided because an increasing empire promises to take only so much of our product and freedom this year as needed for “safety” in the next? How many sessions in tandem have these “representatives” (i.e., of the media) betrayed us? At which point do we admit they're seizing an ever bigger percentage of our product, not just spending more money? We do have options. When Roman citizens grew weary of broken covenants, they found relief in the hills - leaving their city elders without revenues for a time. Once those senators started acting their age and listening, tribunes intervened on behalf of the people.
We in the vanguard must suffer zero taxes or interest during twenty-four hours of business unusual, while recalling our state’s true and unsullied history, at the same time expressing Alabama’s hopes and prayers for the future. Yes, it is civil disobedience, this refusal to withhold or pay taxes for one whole day. but peaceful unless Big Bro desires it otherwise. Nor do we accept any charges or penalties after the fact, reminding our elected officials they looked the other way when anarchy. as instigated by the mediacracy, was paraded openly. Now that conspiracy is ended.
Nobody needs to participate in this tax revolt, but there will be no second chance to stand alongside those of us moving first.

Black judge looks to parlay 9% black vote into 25% of the booty
R WIiVft. il	^---------------------------------------HATRED AGAINST THE SYMBOL
BALDWIN COUNTY, Alabama, after a 14-year gerrymandering experiment based on race, returns to its legally constituted four-member commission - not because the seven-member plan ordered by a black federal judge who consistently ignored U.S. Supreme Court rulings failed to seat his black commissioner, but due to its not keeping him there. End of experiment? No way. The media now suggest “cumulative voting/’ whereby the county’s 9% black population will cast all four of their votes for the same black candidate, thus giving them 25% of the gold. The First Freedom will keep you abreast of bow our New World orderlies manipulate this latest gag.
MARCH TO NO MEDIA DRUMS. ILK. Edgertou, the Black former head of Asheville, N.C.’s NAACP and for the last five years a defender of Southern causes, is a man on a mission. Donning Confederate uniform and carrying his Third National Flag of the Confederacy on Monday, October 14th, 2002, Mr. Edgerton will begin a 1,300 mile march from Asheville to Austin, Texas. The real purpose of ELK. Edgerton’s “March Across Dixie" is threefold. First, he wants to expand awareness of the need to defend Southern heritage, history and the truth of the Confederate cause in the South and across the United States. Second, this is an educational effort to show that our Southern symbols are part of a proud heritage that should be defended, not scorned as many liberal politicians, media and special interests would have you believe. Third, be is calling for support of the Southern Legal Resource Center and the Sons of Confederate Veterans to fight such media attacks.
THE 2000 CONFEDERATES from Calhoun County} Alabama who lost their lives in the War for Southern Independence will now have their names carved upon a black granite memorial 36 feet long by 5 feet high. Tom Smith Anderson Camp 453 Sons of Confederate Veterans (Anniston) Historian Bill Snowden has been busy researching Calhoun county’s Confederate history for over ten years, amassing a tremendous amount of information. While the annals may remain largely incomplete because of continuing media efforts to erase true history and replace it with their themes of treason, racism and hatred, the county commission here has come forward and offered assistance. This project is now attracting some of the biggest local names in architecture and the construction fields as volunteers - a glorious day!
APOLOGIZE FOR THE TRUTH? An August 22nd front-page story with photos of 15 of the 41 people, none of whom were white, having outstanding homicide warrants has resulted in an apology from Philadelphia Daily News editor Ellen Foley because the fugitives shown were obviously all minorities. That only blacks made up the “most wanted” list for the city of Philadelphia would no doubt have also upset Harvard Prof. Noel Ignatiev, which bird we offer his own separate cage in the very next paragraph.
TOO RIDICULOUS to take seriously, too full of hatrechto ignore, on Sept. 9 The Washington Times reported that a Harvard professor wanted to abolish the White race. Noel Ignatiev, founder of a journal called Race Traitor and a fellow at Harvard’s W.E.B. DuBois Institute, a leading Black-studies department, argues in the current Harvard Magazine that “abolishing the White race’’ is “so desirable that some may find it hard to believe** anyone other than “committed White supremacists” would oppose it Hey, fellow, we’re even against offering zookeepers the likes of you. Stay at Harvard where you belong.
SMARTER THAN GRINGOS? The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on Sept. 5 reversed a lower court’s dismissal of the case against Mendoza v. Zirkle Fruit Co., holding that Americans whose wages are negatively impacted by illegal alien employment can bring charges under the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act (RICO). The plaintiffs, Olivia Mendoza, Juana Mendiola et al, “legally authorized to be employed in the United States,” sued two Washington fruit growers, charging that they work for those growers “at wages substantially depressed because of their illegal immigrant hiring scheme.” This is the first time workers have sought redress under RICO from employers who hire illegal immigrants. In its landmark ruling, the Ninth Circuit echoed a similar decision by the Second Circuit last year which allowed a janitorial company to bring RICO charges against a competitor that used illegal alien labor.
WHILE ALL EYES ARE ON IRAQ, will the U.S. Senate pass that extremely controversial treaty? The “united nations” “Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW)” got set up before adjourning for its August recess by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, voting 12-7 along strict party lines to report CEDAW to the full Senate for a quiet vote. This action was led by committee chairman Joseph Biden (D-DE) and committee member Barbara Boxer (D-CA). According to the Senate Republican Policy Committee, CEDAW -the “Rip Van Winkle” treaty - came first before the Senate from President Carter in 1980 but lay dormant for 14 years. In 1994, President Clinton sought Senate action on CEDAW, yet it was too divisive to reach the floor. In its 22-year history, the treaty has never come to a full vote. Why? Because this treaty has serious problems. It would force the U.S. to rewrite national and state laws, “u.n.” social engineering undermining U.S. sovereignty; turn loose on America 23 “u.n.” “inspectors” using “numerical equivalence” (read: quotas) to judge U.S. compliance with this “u.n.” edict; and force women into front-line combat. The socialist world-government fanatics believe they have waited long enough to get CEDAW passed by the U.S. Senate, and are poised to make their move while the public is focused on Iraq.
FULL OF THE USUAL FIZZ. Pepsi has a new patriotic can coming out with pictures of the Empire State Building alongside the Pledge of Allegiance. But Pepsi forgot and left out two little words from the pledge: “~under God.” Pepsi explained they did “not want to offend anyone.” That being the case, let us not offend those Pepsi corporate officers by causing them to look at our money marked, “IN GOD WE TRUST.”
NO TIME FOR SIMPLE ROBBERY. George Phillips of Meridian, Mississippi was going up to bed when his wife told him that he’d left the light on in the garden shed which she could see from the bedroom window. George opened the back door to go turn off the light but saw that there were people in the shed stealing things. He phoned the police, who asked, “Is someone in your house?” and he said no. Informed that all patrols were busy, he should just lock his door, an officer would be along when available, George replied, “Okay.” He hung up, counted to 30, and phoned the police again. “Hello. I just called you a few seconds ago because there were people in my shed. Well, you don’t have to worry about them now cause I’ve just shot them all.” Then he hung up. Within five minutes three police cars, an armed response unit and an ambulance showed up at the Phillips residence, the police catching the
burglars red-handed. One of the policemen said to George: “I thought you said you’d shot them!” Replied George, “I thought you said there was nobody available.”
MEDIA NO LONGER IN CHARGE? On Nov. 5, only the people of Harrison County, Mississippi will decide whether the Battle Flag is to continue flying at Biloxi/Gulfport’s Eight Flags public beach display. There will be none of the options proposed by the mcdla/NAACP front, which angered William Martin when casting the Harrison County Board of Supervisors* solitary vote against the referendum. It’s not likely this coastal area’s two local dailies, nor Associated Press, will inform voters that the flag under attack (by themselves) is the only indigenous banner among all those foreign occupiers, nor that it must be removed for the New World Order to prevail. Let us pray for Dixie.
TAD TOO TIMID. The following hotels along the Mississippi Gulf Coast have removed the Mississippi flag from their businesses. Please avoid patronizing Biloxi Beach Resort, Comfort Inns, Days Inn Ocean Springs, Economy Inns, Grand Casino Gulfport, President Casino Hotel, Holiday Inn Express Ocean Springs, Ramada Limiteds, Travelodges, and Best Inn. However, all Holiday Inns, except the one in Ocean Springs, fly the state flag.
IMAGINE ALL THE PEEPUL living for today, and, just imagine, I wonder if you can, no religion too, and, uh, please excuse the syntax, of a dumbed-down melody, but haven’t you yet noticed, we’re worse off than before? And while Leviathan’s 1960s War on Errorism continues in the trenches that were once public schools, a single brave student wearing the symbols of his heritage has aroused now eight to sport such clothing daily, laments Sarasota County, Florida School District spokeswoman Sheila Weiss, who imagines all schools should have bans similar to her peecee dictates, though the rules are up to each school, um, so long as their decisions are right, er, left. “When there’s hatred involved in that symbol, and negative behaviors involved in that symbol... absolutely it shouldn’t be allowed,” she is quoted as saying by the Sarasota Herald-Tribune.
SILVERHILL HERITAGE FESTIVAL on Sept. 21 welcomed real diversity to this Lower Alabama annual happening. It’s not advertised ahead of time, which keeps the crowds small enough to fit beneath the town's ancient oaks and one traffic light. In the 10 AM parade strutted musicians and hoop-skirted belles, a Battle Flag proudly borne by a trooper from North Carolina in Confederate uniform, Czech and Swedish costumed marchers and others, followed by horse drawn carriages. Across from the pavilion’s band playing to those gathered under canopies and in the bleachers, Dixie Outfitters was selling Forbidden Symbols and giving out The First Freedom. Seems almost everybody is for Southern heritage! This revival is on the internet, at the fairs, in the schools, and, like it or lump it, the Media/NAACP front is weakening. Every time some idiot director (whether school or corporate) aims at the BF and shoots himherself in the foot. Dixie Outfitters rings up another thousand sales.

comes always as a two-pronged attack: from “the offended” and their pro malo media associates. After a three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in April upheld a trial judge’s ruling that the state is required under the First Amendment to issue license plates bearing the Sons of Confederate Veterans version having the Battle Flag logo, now that full court has voted 6-5 to deny a request for a rehearing. Sorry, N A AC Pies, that’s it.
MINDING ALABAMA’S BUSINESS. The Center for Reproductive Law and Policy in New York City has filed a pro malo lawsuit on behalf of six abortion clinics and two abortionists seeking to avoid the recently enacted Alabama Woman’s Right to Know Act, which law ensures that every woman considering an abortion receives complete information on the procedure, its risks and her alternatives, and that whoever submits to an abortion does so only after giving her voluntary and informed consent to the procedure. To that end, women seeking abortions here must be provided with clear information on fetal progress, abortion methods and alternatives at least 24 hours before undergoing an abortion. So butt out, Jew York; go boycott South Africa.
TORONTO AND VANCOUVER could suffer race riots unless there are major changes to a federal immigration policy that blatantly misleads Canadians about the program’s benefits, says an explosive new Fraser Institute study. Author Martin Collacott warns Canada’s reputation as a tolerant society could be undermined, not because people are racist but because those in major cities - including existing immigrant populations — are feeling overwhelmed. Soaring populations in major urban areas are raising concerns about pollution, traffic congestion and pressures on the health and education systems. While there is no evidence that any Canadian communities are on the verge of experiencing the tensions and riots involving immigrant communities that have taken place in a number of British cities in recent years, it would be folly to assume that such events could never happen in Canada.
ON THE INTERNET (which is putting the mediae racy out of business) his handle is kennethH20s@aol.com. a cute way of identifying superpatriot Kenneth Waters. It was Sept. 13th, and at first only 18 people had shown up in answer of Ken’s call to flag Cherokee High school. But that number grew to over 30 once school let out around 3:15. While waiting, a Georgia State Patrol officer pulled over and, asking not to be mentioned by name, suggested the flaggers should be down at the school board offices as well. They were joined by 14 students, 10 young men and 4 young ladies walking or driving across the street waving their colors, seven student trucks altogether flying Battle Flags and saying it was the talk of school: they couldn't wait to get out there and join the movement to boot from office those responsible for replacing Georgia's state flag with a peecee rag, and those telling these students they couldn't even wear Confederate symbols on their clothing. Rebellion is in the air, a fact which the controlled media can't hide any longer. At Cherokee High, they’re now starting their own after-school flagging movement.

I am saddened to learn of Vanderbilt’s removing the name “Confederate*’ from Confederate Memorial Hall, named many years ago to honor our heritage by the United Daughters of the Confederacy who raised one third of its cost. So Vanderbilt is now bitten by that Political Correctness bug that’s storming our country, cowering down to ignorance in place of honoring truth. This isn’t what made Vanderbilt and our country great; it diminishes all. Having talked with several of your graduates who will be sending no more money, 1 promise you I'll be contacting as many as possible, with others likewise repeating this disgrace toward our Southland by the so-called leadership at Vanderbilt Here's hoping you’ll reconsider such bad judgment. I would like to again be able to respect that school, as 1 have in the past. Deo Vindicet Joseph Wyatt Willis Cdr. Ala. Society MOS&B 2nd Lt. Cdr. Alabama Division, Sons of Confederate Veterans [Here comes the reply, interspersed with plaintiffs rebuttals. —Ed.]
Dear Mr. Willis,
Vanderbilt University has designated residence hall “Confederate Memorial Hall” as simply “Memorial Hall.” The new name is intended to honor the men and women who have lost their lives in this country’s armed conflicts.
Mary, I understand very well that you have changed the name to Memorial Hall. But the money to build it was given by the UDC in honor of our proud heritage and Confederate ancestors I think, and not Iall1 veterans. I’m sure you could raise money and build a "Memorial Halt" if such were desired as the actual reason. I may be slow, but not that slow. Ma'am, thank you!
The decision to change the name of the building was not made lightly. It came after careful consideration and review, and will be effective immediately. This is one of a number of changes that have been made at Vanderbilt in recent years to create a positive, inclusive environment, and to ensure that our facilities and symbols do not inadvertently reflect values that are inconsistent with the University’s mission.
Mary, I am sure the changes were not made lightly but probably due to ignorance ofhistory, not caring for the account ofour Southern people. Not lightly? No, probably heavy-handed Political Correctness at its fullest. Some years back, Mary, this was called "Reconstruction
Confederate Memorial Hall was constructed in 1935 on the campus of the former George Peabody College for Teachers with partial funding from the United Daughters of the Confederacy. Its stated purpose was to provide housing for young women who would become teachers at a time when they were sorely needed in the South. George Peabody College merged with Vanderbilt in 1979, and its facilities
CNN spiked Connie Chung’s widely-publicized “expose” on Yale University’s Order of Skull & Bones, chapter 322, which counts among its membership President George W. Bush and his father and grandfather before him, and influential aide and former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Brent Scowcroft and Connie Chung ain’t talking. The program, billed at CNN’s website to air at 8:00 PM ET, September 4, did not materialize; in its place was a story of a murder trial in Florida. Contacted repeatedly at CNN studios, representatives of Ms. Chung and producers of Connie Chung Tonight were either “unavailable** or had “no comment.”

Yes, I think you are right on that, Mary, but you forgot to mention the name was given to honor brave Confederate veterans who fought with stalwarts like Robert E. Lee and Nathan Bedford Forrest, a good old Tennessee General! That is how it got its name Mary. Not because teachers were trained there.
In 1989, after a renovation of the building led to a vigorous campus debate over the appropriateness of the name, a plaque was added to the building explaining origins and historical significance of the then-Confederate Memorial Hall, and the contributions of the United Daughters of the Confederacy to its construction. That historic marker will remain in its current location inside the lobby.
Thank you all, Mary, for the crumbs that you let us poor Southern Confederates have. Ifit were notfor the generosity of the Yankees and Carpetbaggers I suppose there would be no Southern people around anymore!

Vanderbilt University Alumni Relations Mary, I thank you for seeing that point. We of the South have always known this. But you missed something else. The UDC was very good at the things they supported, and they honored their ancestors, true enough. But, guess what made them the UDC, Mary. Yep, it was those Confederate veterans that you are now dishonoring by removing their name from the Hall! And, as already stated, after having spoken with several of your graduates I am assured that you will be missing more funds if you all persist in this doing away with Dixie, as now seems the fad!

EMANCIPATING THE TRUTH:
Lincoln killed constitution, states’ rights - and 600,000 soldiers
If only today fs armchair warriors in Washington could appreciate the madness of their lust for power, as does this retired Airborne colonel!
By Nick Jongebloed
Back in early August I responded to a letter to the Editor in the Mobile Register titled: The right place for Rebel flag. The letter’s author attempted to make the case that the Confederate Flag “Stars and Bars” should not be displayed on public property because it “instigated a violent and bloody rebellion to divide and overthrow this nation.” This is blatantly false, but, tragically, the history that has been promoted in our public education system for many, many years.
President Bush having decried the “large and disturbing” gaps in our students' knowledge of history, his administration will take action to improve teaching the history of the United States. In a special ceremony honoring the 215th anniversary of the signing of the Constitution (Article VII: Seventeenth Day of September in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and Eighty seven), the President noted that one-third of fourth-graders do not know how to recite the Pledge of Allegiance. He also commented that 20% of high school seniors think Germany was a U.S. ally during WW1I and “28% of eighth-graders do not know why the Civil War was fought ” The President concluded:
“Our Founders believed that the study of history and citizenship should be at the core of every American’s education; yet today our children have large and disturbing gaps in their knowledge of history.”
President Bush pledged that his administration would bolster civics and history subjects with federal dollars, and send copies of the Constitution and the Emancipation Proclamation to public school classrooms. I found this to be an interesting combination. For many years private organizations have sent tens of thousands of pocket editions of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution to our schools and civic organizations across the country. You would think that if the goal is to study the history of the United States, you would start with what came first: the Declaration of Independence and then the Constitution. Giving the Emancipation Proclamation the same position of historical significance as the Constitution and omitting reference to the Declaration of Independence simply reinforces so many of the cherished beliefs about the war, its causes and justifications. The greatest myth concerns slavery as the primary cause of the conflict. Prior to the attack on the Confederate States, slavery had existed, under the Constitution, from the very beginning of the United States of America. Indeed, it was only after two years of unimaginable slaughter and destruction upon the Confederate States that Lincoln raised the issue of emancipation, and then as a war measure limited to areas under Confederate control. It was designed to cause a slave uprising behind the lines of the Confederate forces and hasten their defeat by the Union army. As T.H. Williams wrote in his book titled: Lincoln and the Radicals, “The Emancipation Proclamation was not the glorious human rights document it was held up to be ... so celebrated and misunderstood by later generations.”
This self imposed censorship has now ended with the internet and an explosion of information to all citizens who can read. Two excellent books recently published and authored by distinguished scholars of history are examples: When in the Course of Human Events, arguing the case for Southern secession, by Charles Adams, and The Real Lincoln, a new look at Abraham Lincoln, his agenda and an unnecessary war, by Thomas J. Dilorcnzo
The letter writer quotes from Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address, “Four Score and Seven Years Ago,” which has been exposed by Charles Adams, Thomas J. Dilorcnzo and many scholars of history to be based on errors and falsehoods. Tragically, this same Address was recycled by Governor Pataki of New York at the New York Ground Zero Commemoration on 9-11 -02. Only after one reviews the true history of Lincoln and his distortions of what the Founding Fathers created can one estimate how inappropriate this speech was for such a tragic event. The number of citizens killed in that terrorist attack, approximately 3,000, pales when compared to the 600,000 Americans who died in Lincoln's war against the Southern States.
Lincoln's use of the term “Civil War” is again a deception. A civil war is fought to take over a state by opposing groups, e.g., Russia in 1917 or China in the 1940s. His “civil” war having meant to stop Southern independence, Lincoln attempted to make the case that the South was out to conquer the Northern federation. This made as much sense as to say the original colonies wanted to destroy the British Empire in 1776. The Southern states withdrew from the Union by a democratic process, the
same process used when they joined the Union in the first place. Britain went to war against the colonies in 1776 to prevent them from seceding. Lincoln’s was a war of conquest to destroy the Confederacy and rule over the conquered lands of the South.
Charles Adams makes the point that Lincoln's logic at Gettysburg and elsewhere reveals him as “...a crafty trial lawyer who has mastered the tools of his profession, using the best logic he could muster to support his client’s (The North’s) case, however bad that case may be.”
Thomas Dilorenzo makes the case that Lincoln was a calculating politician who waged the bloodiest war in American history so that he could build an empire that rivaled Great Britain. The Founding Fathers intended to establish a form of government that was limited in scope and highly decentralized. Lincoln and his supporters had visions of a highly centralized and activist state. The Confederacy of the South stood in his way and he had to subvert the constitution, abolish states’ rights and start a war that resulted in 600,000 dead soldiers on both sides to get his way. This war and the 12 years of brutal occupation during the Reconstruction period, a period described by historians James Rhodes and James Randall as “a vindictive, abusive, corrupt, political racket” left wounds that haunt many in the South to this day. Indeed, just before his death in 1870, General Robert E. Lee spoke of the so-called “just and lasting peace” of Lincolnspeak: “Had 1 foreseen these results of subjugation, 1 would have preferred to die at Appomatox with my brave men, my sword in my right hand.”	□

The lies of globalism
By David Duke
EURO National Director www.whitccivilrights.com
Today, I speak about the genocidal effects of globalism as well as its inherent contradictions.
As all of us know, the world is getting smaller. Incredible advancements in transportation and communication make it so. Many national corporations that once had minor branches overseas have now become truly international, and their own loyalties have gone beyond their national origins. Profit is the one flag, their only loyalty. It flies above nation, culture, race, morality, health, concerns over the environment, anything. These global concentrations of enormous wealth have become a juggernaut, amassing huge power and weight like a snowball turning into an avalanche. Interwoven with their enterprises, the globalists dominate the media, which, of course, have also become truly international. With these they control the democracies, where the shccple cannot distinguish between a free press and a controlled one.
Many, in fact, labor under the impression we have a free press in America. Hah! That is the looniest notion imaginable here in the first fledgling years of the 21 st century. Yes, we are free in America to publish a pamphlet or house newspaper, maybe even put a few controversial flyers out on the street, although in many communities if the pamphlet is politically incorrect you are liable to be hassled by the police and local authorities. Many communities for instance have laws that you cannot leave leaflets at people's doorsteps or put them on automobiles. Of course, you cannot distribute them at shopping centers, which are private property, and the United Colors of Benetton might get angry and have you arrested if you persist.
SmaU circulation newspapers and such literature have never been really dangerous to any power structure, at least not since they were state of the art communication devices as during the American Revolution. [Dave, give me your address and I'll send you a copy of The First Freedom. -Ed.] Now if a major media chain or even a daily newspaper or local TV station gets out of step, it can be a problem for the globalists, but they have that so well under control it is amazing. The newspapers, magazines, TV stations and networks are so much in lockstep it is incredible. In many European major cities, though, the control is not as extensive as in the United States.
For instance, in many European cities, and I can give Paris as an example, among the many daily newspapers more than one basically sides with the Palestinians rather than the Israelis. The same is true in Rome. In America, there are none. That's right, out of over 2000 dailies, not a single newspaper in America presents the Palestinian view of the conflict rather than the Israeli. Oh yes, there are a few papers that will sometimes disagree with the Israeli government on a particular point, just as there is even some Jewish opposition in Israel that will do the same thing; but, on the fundamentals, every American paper, Jewish-owned or not, is quite supportive of Israel no matter what atrocity, what murder and mayhem, or what human rights they blatantly violate.
1 have mentioned an article appearing in Jewish newspapers for Jewish consumption that stated 17 out of 19 members of the Israeli Cabinet support a law that prohibits Palestinians from buying land in Jewish areas of Israel or even living in apartment buildings with Jews! That’s right, you read me correctly. How would the American press scream if any governor in the United States, and his cabinet, supported a law to forbid African-Americans from living in all-White apartment buildings! Of course Israeli schools are rigidly segregated. But where is the outcry in the pro-lsraeli media of America? Remember the unanimous outcry in the American press against
Apartheid in South Africa? For some reason there is no outcry at all in the American press about the Apartheid in Israel. Why? Well, why do you think?
The horrible injustice to the Palestinians should be so obvious that I shouldn't have to even mention it; the mainstream press if it were honest should do that. But I have to point out to my fellow Americans who have been spoon fed everything by the I Jewish supremacists, what should be all too obvious: Israel invaded the West Bank and Gaza 35 years ago. There were almost no Jews living there. Israel put the Palestinian people under a brutal military occupation and denied them all semblance of liberty. Of course, some very brave Palestinians resisted this brutal occupation. America and most countries recognize that people have an absolute right to resist foreign military occupation. Over the course of these 35 years Israel has killed thousands. Please listen to me closely. It has killed thousands of men, women and children. It has blinded, maimed, crippled and disfigured tens of thousands, including thousands of children; purposely destroyed thousands of homes, businesses, hospitals, and schools. Incarcerated and tortured, yes, I said tortured, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians. Americans don't even know that torture of Palestinians is legal in Israel. And, to top it all off, during this period of destruction and murder they have built hundreds of Jewish settlements on the very Palestinian lands they occupy. While they destroy Palestinian homes and cities, they bring in Jews from places like New York and Moscow and build homes on settlements in the midst of the sorely oppressed Palestinians.
Don’t hold your breath for a huge protest of these human rights violations by the American press. Read my article on press control, and 1 can prove to you that Jewish supremacists control the vast majority of the American media.
So, enough on the so-called free press. The point here must be that the same media in lockstep for Israel are also in lockstep for the New World Order and the globalism that it represents. For the last few decades of my life I have earnestly tried to inform people that those who are the true forces behind globalism are, in actuality, racial supremacists. But they are not the so-called racial supremacists the media talk about. They are not European, African or Asian supremacists, they are Jewish supremacists. These Jew^h supremacists have a master plan that should be obvious for anyone to see. They consistently undermine the culture, racial identity and solidarity, economy and political independence of
Holocaust denier
So long as warmongers own the press, expect wars and rumors of wars. Losing the media is where we lost all, and only there can we regain our heritage.
By Monika Junghans-Jones
Having received The First Freedom yesterday, I was so glad to finally see some truth in a Southern paper, viz; the facts about Germany. For, just like the Southern Nation, the German Nation and her people have repeatedly been misrepresented, from the accusation as to who started WWI and WW1I to lies told about the "Holocaust." There weren’t six million Jews living in Europe at the time of the Third Reich.
A bom German, I became naturalized in 1989 when making the choice as to whether I loved the South or Germany more, for my loyalty would have to be 100%. I chose the Southland. But, in being loyal to one nation, 1 will not remain quiet while lies are told concerning the land of my ancestors, my birth and my home until 18 years old. My father was only 14 when drafted into the German Army to fight the invasion of the world. He did not wear the
every nation in the world; but there is one race they don’t seek to undermine. There is only one exception. There is one nation that is not undermined, and that my friends is the Jewish nation, by which I mean not just Israel, but the Jewish supremacists around the world who preach their own supremacy among themselves and really think they have some divine right to rule over not only Palestine but the rest of the world as well.
So let's talk about the inconsistencies of this globalism now dominating the world. First they say they are for multiculturalism and for diversity. Let me again state the obvious. The reasons we have different cultures and different races and different national identities is because we have different nations and languages and races. Building a McDonald’s and putting a Coca Cola machine on every street comer of the world is not only injurious to the health of the world’s people, it is uniformity, not diversity.
It is unicultural, not multicultural. Supporting massive immigration into the Western nations is not multicultural; the nations those immigrants come from offer a truly different cultural environment. Melting them into one brown mass does not create diversity; it eventually destroys the indigenous culture of that particular nation. Even more so, it destroys the unique genetic heritage and character of those people and the unique nations that they created. Is it really a good thing for Germans to be outnumbered by Turks in their own nation? Is it good to remake Germany into a land foreign to its own people? Is it good to make whole sections of America into a replica of Mexico? Should the Russian people in the 21st century become dissolved by a massive influx of Asians, a fate Russia diligently avoided for two thousand years?
On the opposite hand, do we really want the Third World to be made economic colonies for the New World Order and the new globalism? What will this do to them, to their own cultures, to the well-being of the world’s ecology?
Let me get something straight for all of you who believe what the Jewish supremacists say about me. Please wake up. I am not a White supremacist; I certainly believe in the differences between races and nations that arc obvious, but I seek no supremacy over anyone; I respect all the peoples and cultures of the world, and say that every people have the right to preserve their heritage, culture, their own political and economic sovereignty.
And I am not racist or hateful about it. I am not hypocritical about it, because what
uniform of a Nazi, but of a German soldier defending his homeland and family. He was also a P.O.W. in an American camp. Want to know about some of the atrocities committed against German prisoners in the U.S. gulags? Ask him.
When I think about the causes of both world wars, and the direct and indirect works of the American Empire under its Zionist and globalist rulers, the genocide committed against German civilians afler Germany had already surrendered in 1945-46 with the self-righteous allies standing around and watching over three million mostly women and children die unnecessarily; the Morgenthau Plan that was only defeated because the English Parliament voted against it; the Marshall Plan that claims to have rebuilt Germany with American Dollars out of philanthropy, a lie - for Germany repaid fourfold, and every penny was safely invested; yes, I get upset to say the least. Germany also rebuilt Israel and is still paying there. On a recent visit to the country of my birth, trying to educate Germans on their true history 1 was warned to be quiet or get locked up by that police state for three to five years.
Since Morgenthau’s dissecting was not
I want for my own people, the European people, is to have the same rights I support for everyone.
I am entirely consistent. The Jewish supremacists are the inconsistent ones, the 1 hypocrites, the racial supremacists. They and their New World Order seek to destroy every nation, every culture, every heritage, every race but their own. They seek a global supremacy over media, economics and governments. I don't seek supremacy ' over other races or nations, but I want Europeans and Americans to maintain our own heritage in our own nations.
I want our children to grow up in a society where they are safe and comfortable, where they can have a life reflecting their own history and their own nature. I don’t want them forbidden to sing a Christmas carol in school because it might offend the increasing numbers of those of different religions; I don’t want them to see George Washington's name taken off their school because African Americans consider him a racist. I don’t want them to face the ugly reality of racial gang violence that so pervades our major cities. I don’t want them to face discrimination, even if given the nice sounding name of affirmative action. I don't want my descendants to go to school and discover they speak the wrong language, English. And I want the standards of Europe and the standards of America to be the standards of my progeny.
Finally, I don’t want to see the eradication of my people from the earth. Every unique life form has a right to live, and so do we! But immigration, miscegenation and low birthrates will destroy us as completely as any traditional genocide.
The diversity that we must preserve is in the world, in nature. The globalists are attempting to make us all listen to the same music; eat the same food, live the same way. They are the enemies of real diversity, and they are the enemies of freedom. The bigger the government the less freedom. How can people in, say, Zurich decide what is best for people in Kashmir? Real freedom comes from small government, not from a global one. The most important freedom of all is the right to live, and to live as your fathers did. We must be able to live in the harmony of our own land and our own culture and our own people.
I understand the Jewish people’s desire to preserve their genotype and their culture and their religion; I share that sentiment and endorse that human right. The difference between us is that I support that right for the Jewish people, for all people, for my own people. The Jewish supremacists on the other hand, seek to destroy every other patriotic movement but their own.
actually put into place, they’ve brought in “Gastarbeiter** to accomplish the same thing. Can’t destroy the people? Okay, just outbreed them. I reckon one can call this a modified Morgenthau Plan.
I get so upset when Southerners are assaulted with the term "racist" and want to be apologetic on this issue; that’s a no-win defense. The word is misappropriated, the wrong people are using it, and we need to concentrate so as to not be manipulated again. It bothers me that Southerners have so little interest in European history, for all this connects.
To me the Zionists and Nazis are one and the same. Look at Roosevelt's Nazi Deal - sacrificing his own people at Pearl Harbor to warrant American involvement in a European conflict by creating false patriotism. And like 9-11, for there is no doubt in my mind that just as Caesar used wars to control his people and enslave them, so did the American Empire on that day. I am now waiting for the next one to occur, when the Southern people again will fight the Empire's unholy war rather than the one for their own cause and freedom.
Anyway, thanks to The First Freedom for publishing the truth.

Sorry we allow ourselves to post only one Scalawag of the Month; maybe this second cowardly attack on the same United Daughters of the Confederacy can be introduced as a |Dishonorable Mention. ”
The Greensboro News & Record has published letters from North Carolina citizens outraged by Aycock principal Melissa Harrelson*s claim that the United Daughters of the Confederacy is “a modem day version of the Ku Klux Klan” Letters by Clint Johnson, author of “Touring the Carolinas’ Civil War Sites," and Alamance County commissioner Tim Sutton are reprinted below.

Aycock, U.D.C. flap result of ignorance Greensboro, NC News A Record. 8-31-02
When school officials scratch their heads and wonder why many parents want to take their children out of public schools, they need look no further than what is happening at Aycock Middle School. The principal presented the United Daughters of the Confederacy with a blanket condemnation as being Ku Klux Klan members because they sponsor a contest that has a Southern theme. I would suspect questioning would reveal this principal knows little about the UDC, The War Between The States, and perhaps the complete list of letters of the alphabet. According to the National Educational Association, our public schools* mission has changed from education of children to teaching tolerance of every world view of life, no matter how radical to the United States. Considering that the ladies of the UDC live in Greensboro, I think the Aycock Middle School principal is breaking the principles of tolerance and her union's directives.
- Clint Johnson, Winston-Salem Descendant knocks educators' decision
I read about the complaint at Aycock Middle School regarding the United Daughters of the Confederacy, and I can tell you that if we have teachers and principals who are this unread then it is no wonder that public education is having its problems. As a charter member of the Alamance County Sons of the Confederacy,
1 can assure you that the historical nature of the theme is all that 1 have ever witnessed, and I honestly believe that the local group here would not tolerate anything beyond that, although I will admit that I do not get to the meetings like I did originally.

It’s time to assess whether we9re on our way to a well-regulated state, or already there.
By Fred Reed
We tell ourselves that in America we are the Free People. 1 wonder whether we might not better be called the Obedient People, the Passive People, or the Admonished People.
I doubt that any country, anywhere, has been so regulated, controlled, and directed as we are. We are bred to obey. And obey we do.
It begins with the sheer volume of law, rules, and administrative duties. Most of the regulation makes sense in isolation, or can be made plausible. Yet there is so much of it.
Used to be if you wanted a dog, you got a dog. It wasn't really the government's business. Today you need a dog license, a shot card for the dog, a collar and tags, proof that the poor beast has been neutered, and you have to keep it on a leash and walk it only in designated places. It’s all so we don’t get rabies.
Or consider cars. You have to have a title, insurance, and keep it up to date; tags, country sticker, inspection sticker, emissions test. Depending where you are, you can't have chips in the windshield, and you need a zoned parking permit. You have to wear a seatbelt. And of course there are unending traffic laws. You can get a ticket for virtually anything, usually without knowing that you were doing something wrong.
Then there's paperwork. If you have a couple of daughters with college funds in the stock market, annually you have to fill out three sets of federal taxes, three sets of state, and file four state and four federal estimated tax forms, per person, for a total of twenty-four. This doesn’t include personal property taxes for the country, business licenses, tangible business-assets forms, and so on.
Now, I’m not suggesting that all these laws are bad. Stupid, frequently, but evil, no. Stopping at traffic lights is probably a good idea, and certainly is if I’m crossing the street. But the laws never end. Bring a doughnut on the subway, and you get arrested. Don’t replace your windows without permission in writing from the condo association. Nothing is too trivial to
inquiry to be limited. It is one thing to set a policy that you feel is the best for all, but to make unlearned statements in doing so does not help the image of public education and those in the position of administering it.	- Tim D. Sutton, Burlington
be regulated. Nothing is not some government’s business.
I wonder whether the habit of constant obedience to infinitely numerous rules doesn’t inculcate a tendency to obey any rule at all. By having every aspect of one’s life regulated in detail, does one not become accustomed to detailed regulation? That is, detailed obedience?
For many it may be hard to remember freer times. Yet they existed. In 1964, when I graduated from high school in rural Virginia, there were speed limits, but nobody much enforced them, or much obeyed them. If you wanted to fish, you needed a pole, not a license. You fished where you wanted, not in designated fishing zones. If you wanted to carry your rifle to the bean field to shoot whistle pigs, you just did it. You didn’t need a license and nobody got upset.
To buy a shotgun in the country store, you needed money, not a background check, waiting period, proof of age, certificate of training, and a registration form. If your tail light burned out, then you only had one tail light. If you wanted to park on a back road with your girl friend, the cops, all both of them, didn’t care. If you wanted to swim in the creek, you didn't need a Coast Guard approved lifejacket.
It felt different. You lived in the world as you found it, and behaved because you were supposed to, but you didn’t feel as though you were in a white-collar prison. And if anybody had asked us, we would have said that the freedom was worth more to us than any slightly greater protection
against rabies, thank you. Which nobody ever got anyway.
Today, the Mommy State never leaves off protecting us from things I’d just as soon not be protected from. We must wear a helmet on a motorcycle: Kevorkian can kill us, but we cannot kill ourselves. Why is it Mommy Government’s business whether I wear a helmet? In fact I do wear one, but it should be my decision.
And so it goes from administrative minutiae (emissions inspections) to gooberish Mommyknowsbestism (“Wea-a-ar your life jacket, Johnny!") to important moral decisions. Obey in small things, obey in large things.
You must hire the correct proportion of
Fred Reed knows such characters, too.
this and that ethnic group, watch your sex balance, prove that you have the proper attitude toward homosexuals. You must let your children be politically indoctrinated in appropriate values, let your daughter get an abortion without telling you, accept affirmative action no matter how morally repugnant you find it.
And we do. We are the obedient people.
As the regulation of our behavior becomes more pervasive, so does the mechanism of enforcement grow more nearly omnipresent. In Washington, if you eat on the subway, they really will put you in handcuffs, as they recently did to a girl of twelve. In 1964 in King George County, the cop would have said, “Sally, stop that." Arresting a child for sucking on a sourball would never have entered a state trooper’s mind.
Which brings us to an ominous observation. America is absolutely capable of totalitarianism. It won't be the jack booted variety, but rather a peculiarly mindless, bureaucratic insistence on conformity. What we call political correctness is an American approach to political control.
Our backdoor totalitarianism has the added charm of being crazy.
Think about it. Confiscating nail clippers at security gates, arresting the eating girl on the subway, the confiscation from an aging general of his Congressional Medal of Honor because it had points, the countless ejections from school of little boys for drawing soldiers of the Trade Centers in flames, playing cowboys and
Indians, for pointing a chicken finger and
saying Bang.
This isn't intelligent authoritarianism aimed at purposeful if disagreeable ends. It is the behavior of petty and stupid people, of minor minds over-empowered, ignorant, but angry and charmed to find that they can push others around. It is the exercise of power by people who have no business having any.
And we obey. We are the obedient people.	©Fred	Reed	2002

No Confederate flag debate if our enemies had not written its history
By Linda Sewell
Here’s my answer to Emily Streyer|
Carlisle’s diatribe in the Sept. 5, 2002 Duke University]
Chronicle.
Ms. Carlisle: You quite obviously are writing about something for which you
know very little or nothing; a big mistake when you attack the Confederate Flag with lies and propaganda in the South. First,
■ “the NAACP isn’t responsible for the flag debate. It's been going on since the flag went up." Wrong! The NAACP vowed at its national convention in Houston in 1998 to remove all vestiges of the Confederacy within a decade. The flag was not under attack until a dying and near bankrupt NAACP discovered they could enrich their pockets and keep their cushy jobs by making the flag a symbol of “hatred." The Confederate Battle Flag is a battle flag, nothing more. To blame the flag for its misuse is no different than blaming a gun for shooting wp^one ,pr, blaming a
pencil for spelling errors. All are incorrect comparisons. Second,
■	“most South Carolinians of every race want the flag removed." Once again, you are wrong. Where, might I ask, did you get your statistics for this misinformation? Every poll in every state in the South, especially in South Carolina, as well as some states in the north, favor flying the Confederate Battle Flag. Check out the poll results for yourself, instead of simply stating your opinion and lies.
■	“Flying the flag anywhere is insensitive, but supporters want to keep it because the alternative is admitting to racism." / take it you aren 1 aware that a right not to be offended is nowhere to be found in our Constitution, nor Bill of Rights. Freedom of expression on the other hand is guaranteed by the First Amendment. Check it out for yourself before continuing to inflict your opinion on others. You might help those who are offended by educating them to the truth instead of bowing to their whining demands. I love the Confederate Battle Flag and will continue to fly it in honor of my revered ancestors and heroes until it is pried from my cold, dead hands. If that , makes me a racist, then so be it
■	“Even so, the opposing view must be accommodated.** What utter nonsense. Why should we accommodate another view, when our view is completely ignored? For your information, tolerance is a two-way street. It must also be given by those who constantly seek it.
■	“Being sensitive is more important than celebrating our heritage in this particular manner." Once again, you have been brainwashed by Yankee textbooks and propaganda. Obviously, you have no heritage for which you can be proud. Truly a shame! Personally, I have ancestors who fought, died and were imprisoned, defending the CSA Constitution and the Southland against tyranny and an illegal invasion. They fought to preserve their state’s sovereignty, illegal taxation, their homes, their families and their honor. They did not, however, fight to preserve slavery, a misnomer which continues to be taught from Yankee textbooks still today. Those who do not revere their heritage will one day lose it
[Emily Streyer Carlisle is a master’s student in the economics department and the Health Policy Certificate program. Her column appeals on alternating Thursdays.]
You should stick to writing about things for which you have been properly educated. To write of something for which you are grossly misinformed raises to mind the old quote, “It is better to be silent and thought a fool, than to speak and remove all doubt." You have just made that case in point. Learn the truth. It’s a terrible thing to waste a mind.

“Every man should endeavor to understand the meaning of subjugation before it is too late... It means the history of this heroic struggle will be written by the enemy; that our youth will be trained by Northern schoolteachers; will learn from Northern school books their version of the war; will be impressed by the influences of history and education to regard our gallant dead as traitors, and our maimed veterans as fit objects for derision..." - Confederate Major General Patrick Cleburne, from his January, 1864, letter which proposed the emancipation and enlistment of Black Southerners into the Confederate Army (

That is, her purpose for being at the Foley Civic Center on May 23, just prior to our June Primary, was to greet and influence the public - had anybody come except a few political papas and daughters, the forty or so candidates themselves, each attending a folding table filled with leaflets containing the usual promises, plus myself and another reporter. Yep, these were the upcoming administrators of The Big Plan, and here was a perfect evening to discuss it privately among themselves.
Having refused her brochure - going so far as to explain that Democrat Governor Don Siegelman and Republican challenger Bob Riley had both lost a vote by taking up the media chant for a blanket rewrite of the Alabama Constitution -1 at least accepted a cookbook. Libertarian John Sophocleus would be my choice.
“Which case?” I asked, in response to her question.
"The garbage thing. District Attorney David Whetstone *s campaign to make you, ‘the last holdout,* comply with Baldwin County’s rural garbage pickup mandate.”
“There he is,” I replied, pointing across the room. “Why not just ask him? There are still quite a few of us in noncompliance, and l*m talking about citizens. Add to that the illegal aliens he doesn’t want to know about, those who simply use other people’s dumpsters, and we’re a whole bunch. Back in 1994, my continued access to the public landfill denied because refusing his orders to produce a weekly quota of garbage, I began sharpening my wit on the Whetstone and have done so ever since.”
“What do you do with your garbage?” “Same as repeatedly explained to the county commission. Our table scraps go to the compost bin. Old papers to a Silverhill church for recycling. And rubbish glass, tin aadplariif to the Pensacola ]gndfill, H&hich has not yet refused my money. ”
“Why were you thrown in jail?”
“Once for passing out literature in a public place, as you would be doing here, unmolested in your case, if anybody had shown up. A second time for hauling my six-month’s accumulation of trash to the county landfill without having signed up for weekly garbage. Since then I’ve taken it to Florida.”
“And Whetstone says nothing?”
“There’s the man; go, ask. Honing my wit on him is expensive but satisfying. You sec, the first time he brought my ’caravan* of trash haulers into court, he chickened out, dropped charges after discovering that 'Failure to Participate In and Subscribe to Mandatory Collection [sic]* would never stick. So, for four years he pretended every rural household was in compliance, until I revived the issue by bringing trash to my county's landfill instead of Pensacola’s in hopes the media would admit all had not been resolved on the road to Utopia. No such luck; Clousseau 'trumped* my plan with charges that taking trash to the public dump, stopping on the scales to be weighed in and offering to pay was ’Trespassing.*. Oh, and be had a second trump card. Seems that asking which section was receiving dry trash that day constituted ’Interfering with Government Operations.’ I'm not making this up."
“You were convicted the second time?”
“Worse than that. Four deputy wagons zoomed to the dump. They impounded my pickup, put me in leg irons and handcuffs, threw me in Robertsdale jail and, in the middle of the night, hauled me to the county lockup at Bay Minette. Though many years a local resident and property owner with sufficient bank deposits, they made it so that my wife would not know in time to bring six thousand dollars cash as bond. I marveled at Whetstone’s bluntness. Yes, I’m now a twice-convicted felon."
Just then. District Attorney John David Whetstone ambled by. “Hi again, Olaf.”
The Riley for Governor lady smiled. □

State auditors unable to audit AHC
How can the Alabama Historical Commission spend tike drunken sailors for whatever pleases, most anything except Alabama history and never be broke? Answer: they keep the books, you ’re paymaster,\
By Ellen Williams
President. The Alabama Coalition
At the September 16, 2002 executive committee meeting of the Alabama Historical Commission (AHC), when the motion was made to have a yearly audit of receipts, expenditures and outgo, the discussion that followed focused mainly on denouncing the Alabama Public Examiner’s Office. Mr. Bill Drinkard expressed regrets that the Public Examiners’ office “...could not do it.” Commissioner Tate added that “Public records will have to be published, but not the work papers; they’re confidential.” Commissioner Craig Sheldon asked, “What level is this audit going to?*
My letter to the AHC follows - in the hope that at the next quarterly meeting we shall learn more about the missing audit. *****
Dr. Lee Warner, Executive Director Alabama Historical Commission 468 South Perry Street Montgomery, Alabama 36130-0900 Dear Dr. Warner
I.) I am requesting a copy of all written correspondence which AHC received from the office of the Alabama Public Examiners
in reference to their inability to audit the Alabama Historical Commission’s books. Please include not only the Examiners final disposition of the matter, but all memos, letters, emails, etc. which transpired while they were making the audit attempt. If you recall specific questions asked via phone conversations, please include that “to the best of your recollection.”
2.) I would also like your personal explanation as to why the auditors were unable to complete an audit on AHC’s accounts.
Your “Public Access” policy states that material requested by a citizen will be available for pickup or mailing within ten working days. Therefore, allowing for 4 days in transit, 1 will expect the requested material by October 7 in the mail. 1 am sending copies of this letter to two other commissioners because you stated at the September 16 committee meetings that you never received another letter of request for material of a different nature; therefore in the event that you don’t get this letter, 1 am asking the two commissioners to pass along their letters to you.
If the above material is lengthy and will involve exorbitant costs to the commission, please call me collect at: 251-246-9850 so that 1 can wire a money order. I do not wish to delay receipt of these materials by having to correspond by the mails.
Thank you for your cooperation in this matter.	Sincerely,
Ellen Williams (Mrs.)

The twenty-first century meets the First Amendment
[Sunday, September 1,2002 12:39 PM]
Yesterday’s flagging convoy to Ardmore, Alabama (astride the Tennessee line above Huntsville) wasn’t announced to the local police or media, nor to outside Southrons who would’ve come had they been invited. But our dozen vehicles sporting side-mounted Battle Flags were all it rook to put this small town on notice that friendly forces will respond anywhere the mediacracy strikes. We brought our own alternate press and internet reporters, and here are the facts.
According to a story in the Athens News Courier on Friday, August 23, 2002, “Ardmore Police Chief Doc Oliver said reports that his officers are stopping cars displaying the rebel flag are untrue. He said he did recently warn some students driving vehicles sporting the flags, but the emblem was not the source of the controversy. ’We don’t keep them from having the flag. That’s their business,’ Oliver said. ‘But we don’t want them making racial slurs and bothering people.’ ”
But ARTICLE II of the Bill of No Rights (September issue of The First Freedom) says: “You do not have the right to never be offended.”
WAFF announced on August 22: “The Confederate Flag is the focus of a controversy in Ardmore, Alabama.
“Some rebellious teens are forcing Ardmore police to regulate the Rebel Flag. Police say there’s nothing wrong with flying your southern colors but some people are taking it too far. They’re waving it in the way of other cprs and yelling discriminating remarks. Some teens even hung black dolls from their flags.
“William Oliver, Ardmore Police Chief said, ‘As long as they’re sitting around we don’t care... as long as they're not causing problems sitting next to the road and flashing it.’
“So far, three warnings have been issued for carelessly waving of the confederate flag. If those people are caught again, they’ll be charged with disorderly conduct” As explained in our September issue -printed just before this flagging took place and widely distributed in Ardmore - The First Freedom had a problem with those TV and press reports because the same media never seem to notice the far more frequent incidents of Blacks “making racial slurs and bothering people” while
committing rape, robbery and “hate crimes” against Whites.
That’s what this convoy was all about The flag-bearing vehicles, uniform except for one with magnetic signs declaring WE’RE RECONSTRUCTING 1861, were led by Richard and Dianne Lauderdale of nearby Athens into the Ardmore Dairy Queen parking lot for a meeting and refreshments, an animated gathering of which the town became quickly aware by word of mouth. Later in the afternoon we were approached by a couple of those harassed White teens telling their side of the story.
Initially we had been visited by Ardmore Police Chief Oliver, a big, burly man, at that first stop. Hello! he shouted. Unable to stare us down, he then ordered a huge plate of sausages and gulped them down while trying to retain his composure. When Leonard Wilson opened the questioning as to Ardmore’s recent media event, reluctant to state what crime these White boys had committed, what charges were being filed against them or why otherwise deny them the same rights Biloxi Blacks had been enjoying under media encouragement. Chief Oliver hemmed and hawed. We left him sitting there and continued our parade to another location.
At McDonald’s, the next stop, our biggest flags were hoist on the parking lot and friendly locals greeted us warmly. Trying not to block drive-thru customers, we did attract quite a few informants who wished to express themselves in the matter. Josh Whitt, Tony Hensley and Brandon Green had been among those seven youths told to get out and stay out of Ardmore with their Confederate flags and symbols. This wasn't the story we had got from the big police chief, who maintained the media were lying for having apparently correctly given at least that much of the truth in their earlier articles when choosing sides and stirring up this story. But, as stated above, our purpose for being there was simply to show the colors.
Once the media learned their cultural cleansing gambit had backfired, this paper was denied permission to reprint WHNT TV Huntsville’s first report in its entirety [see Letters, page 11]. But we already had local witnesses refuting the information initially fed to some, namely, that nobody’s right to keep and bear the Battle Flag while
in Atmore had been denied, a few having worried our little flagging convoy might “become an embarrassment.”
Any abashment belongs with the media. But how pin shame on those committed to interviewing only such Blacks as respond well to their game of cognitive dissonance by learning to become “offended” any tune a White Southerner displays symbols that must be removed on the way to Utopia? Yes, that’s what the ruckus was about! The media had not wished to hear of these boys being called “white trash” and told their Confederate symbols had to go, big Chief Oliver complying on cue.
When Ardmore Police Officer J. Kennedy pulled into the place and didn’t succeed in spooking us, he got out and was encountered by this reporter approaching the eatery. Kennedy said that no charges had been filed, no arrests made, the media having simply picked up on a complaint to the town by three Blacks that the boys had been throwing racial slurs at Blacks from curbside and. on a succeeding night one of them had decorated his vehicle with a black doll sporting a rope necklace. So what? Are the Ardmore police unaware of today’s rampant Black “music”? Kill the pig rap doesn’t refer to those four-legged animals stuffing Chief Oliver’s sausages. The boys in Ardmore are unruly? Well, tough. Wc weren't there to praise them, but to condemn all this cowardly hypocrisy.
Speaking of which, the McDonald’s manager finally emerged and. alongside Officer Kennedy, whom he had obviously summoned, announced his no soliciting policy. Told wc weren't selling anything, he nevertheless didn’t want us talking with local residents and passing out literature there. As the policeman requested and was given our September issue, the manager reluctantly accepted “just one copy” of The First Freedom. Poor guy. You cant read just one!
So who was Scalawag of the Month? Not Chief Oliver, he isn’t that big. Nor Officer Kennedy, a nice guy. The manager? Too typical of all peecee trainees these days. The media? Getting warm. SCAN A? That’s it! But, with the SCV and that corporation’s own employees having done the story in detail, I thought you might prefer hearing about our side celebrating the First Amendment. Where? Any ol* where.	-	Olaf Childress

GULF SHORES, Sept. 19 - East 21st Avenue ends in a just-finished cul-de-sac surrounded by mostly as yet unoccupied 2-story houses. The blonde, 50-ish woman in shorts was happily mowing a freshly sodded lawn beside a still unnumbered mailbox at what I took to be the right place. Parking next door and checking adjacent boxes to be sure, 1 came nearer and saw that number 62$ was indeed posted by the door. This was it Adjusting ray camera as she approached, I was asked to state my business.
1 replied, giving my name: “A real estate lady wants me to shoot some pictures of the place. This is the Alabama Historical Commission's new house, isn’t it?” She answered that it was.
“Are you with the AHC?” I inquired. “I’m not, but my husband is a director.** “And may 1 ask your name?” “Kolberg,” she replied.
By now I had my pocket pad and pen in hand. “K-o-l-b-c-r-g. Is that right?** She nodded affirmative. “And your husband's first name?”
“Are you a reporter?”
“Yes. 1 was kidding about that real estate lady. Ellen Williams is actually president of the Alabama Coalition, and she thought this AHC purchase would be of concern to
The First Freedom's readers. Here are the last two issues, which you might peruse and see that we have common interests in our state's history.**
“I'm not talking,” she said curtly; then, accepting the papers, disappeared into the house and returned speaking alternately to me and into a cellphone pressed to her ear. My guess was that no one existed at the other end, nor would she call the law and make my day.

MONTGOMERY - Dr. Lee Wamerw * in no hurry to finish repairing the historic monument he boarded up on the capitol’s north side many moons ago; he's too busy purchasing “historical” properties such as the two convenient apartment buildings shown below.

This Alabama Historical Commission president aims to “reinterpret” the state's past in ways that savvy Goat Hill lawmakers know better than to interfere with.

Two committees of AHC meet
By Jane Doughty
After many months of requests for the required public information on meetings of the Alabama Historical Commission (AHC) Executive Committee and other committees, the AHC staff on Monday, September 16, 2002 finally complied. Information on all AHC meetings and other activities hopefully will be posted on the calendar page at www.preserveala.org.
Several interested citizens attended the AHC Executive Committee meeting, which was held in the carriage house on the grounds of the AHC office on South Perry Street in Montgomery.
The meeting began at 11:30 am with five commissioners present, Mr. Smith T, AHC vice-chair presiding in the absence of the chairman. Dr. Allen Cronenberg. Also present were commissioners Drinkard, Tate, Sheldon, and Hawkins. AHC director Lee Warner and six other staff personnel were present.
Director Warner gave a report covering several AHC projects and activities. He began with the Capitol Grounds Project (CGP), stating that due to the CGP lawsuit being dismissed by the judge there was no further legal impediment against it And yet the project is still on hold due to a directive made by the governor in February of this year. Dr. Warner seemed to indicate that things would be different after the November 5th election, but did not give specifics as to what that difference would be. He then stated that he believed money from the Alabama Parks Bond would begin flowing to AHC in a matter of days.
Concerning the AHC property at Ft. Toulouse, he mentioned a conceptual agreement to hire a part-time archaeologist as a consultant there in partnership with the University of Alabama. In response to questioning by a commissioner as to the cost to AHC for this consultant, director Warner said, “$30,000 for one-half of the salary and another $30,000 to get the program started.”
A list of nominees for several AHC awards, including AHC Distinguished Service Award, was presented by staff employee Ellen Mertins, who asked that the Executive Committee make the final selection for the awards. Acting Chairman Smith T reminded the group that the AHC chairman had always appointed a special committee to make the final selection and so he forthwith appointed a committee for that purpose.
Commissioner Smith T had two issues on which he wanted to make a motion to be approved by the committee. The motions would then be presented to the full commission at the next regular meeting. The first called for an annual audit of the AHC, allowing its performance to be assessed by an independent outside entity qualified to undertake such an audit of a state agency. Thht report would be finished and placed in the hands of all AHC commissioners in a timely fashion, with the AHC Finance Committee then issuing a plan at the start of each year beginning with 2002-03. As the motion was discussed, allusions were made to the director's long-promised audit by the Examiners of Public Accounts, though no factual account of its existence surfaced. A vote on the motion was called for, and it passed unanimously.
Then Commissioner Smith T brought up the issue of the long-delayed restoration of the Confederate Monument, which has apparently been wrapped with scaffolding and forgotten. He suggested the Executive Committee submit a motion to the full AHC instructing the director to make plans and restore the monument no later than
2003. Commissioner Smith T reminded the group that a restoration survey had been completed some time back, with the AHC assuring the people of Alabama that the restoration would be accomplished.
Director Warner countered that funding for its restoration was tied to the Capitol Grounds Project (CGP), therefore on hold because of the governor’s instructions for that work. He also stated that the Sons of Confederate Veterans (SCV) had wanted the monument funded with federal money in conjunction with the CGP, AHC having budgeted none of its funds to cover this.
Commissioner Smith T reminded the group that the AHC is responsible for the Confederate Monument’s maintenance and, after much more discussion of the issue, called for a vote on his motion. He voted YES; the other four commissioners voted NO. With that. Commissioner Smith T announced that he would bring this motion before the full AHC at their next quarterly meeting on November 1, 2002, in Valley, Alabama.
Following comments by Mike Chapell and Mr. Dozier on a cemetery project, the executive meeting was adjourned.
Immediately thereafter, an AHC Grants Committee meeting was called to order, the same AHC staff personnel attending, also three of the AHC commissioners: Sheldon, Drinkard, and Hawkins.
The Grants meeting had a one-item agenda. It concerned plans to change the usual process for selection of AHC grants. The following information, given on a handout sheet by staff" meiiibdK. was discussed.
Alabama Historical Commission makes grants to assist in achieving its mission statement and goals: To achieve these ends, the AHC offers four categories of grants from its trust fund or other generated funds: COMPETITIVE. CHALLENGE. CONSULTANT, and DIRECTED. PASSTHROUGH and SPECIAL CATEGORY grants are funded from federal pass-through appropriations from the Historic Preservation Trust Fund or from the Alabama General Fund.
Concepts under consideration
■	Single civilian expert panel
■	Competitive grants limited to survey, planning, education
■	Unitary criteria with priority plans for survey, planning. education
■	Sliding scale for cash
Following discussion on this topic, the meeting was adjourned. Citizens ought to leam more about the activities of the AHC. Plan to attend the next AHC quarterly meeting which will be held on Nov. I at Langdale Elementary School Auditorium, Valley, Alabama, at 10:00 am Central.

We've been denigrated as racists* rednecks* hankies and terrorists* all the while smiling at those media attempts to put us under. Now the hyperbole is in the other court By Thomas E. Guinn
gnn§i I net
An interesting question arose, and it just can't wait unto another day! Presuppose, for the sake of discussion, the Confederate States were now being liberated. Efforts are already underway to fill the seats in our Confederate States Government. So imagine for a moment, all that has been taken care of. We still are left with the issue of the NAA.CP., S.P.L.C, A.C.L.U. and a host of others who have terrorized us. Sol many unwanted and undesirables in our Southland! What do we do with them? 1 love this part, don't you?
As a newly independent nation we would be faced with a golden opportunity which comes only once in a thousand years. We get to decide who is and is not a Confederate States citizen. And we decide the standards to be applied.
Anyone interested yet?
Each member State of the Confederacy might decide, within its own respective borders, who is and is not a citizen. Judges would immediately be replaced with Confederate States citizens, so the Yankee liberals will be gone. We declare these groups to be what they are. domestic terrorists, through a Confederate Court Order seizing their membership lists and denying citizenship to every member of | such subversive groups. Now, remember, some of you squeamish, we are taking nothing from them, nothing whatsoever. They were beforehand “U.S. Citizens." and. in being denied Confederate States citizenship, they lose nothing. They are still “U .S. CitizensAre you still with me?
We simply declare these folks to be undesirables and unqualified tor citizenship or residency within the borders of the Confederate States. We issue them a six month temporary passport; time enough to settle their affairs, at the end of which period they may on an individual basis apply for extension; howbeit most will be denied. We then give them an escort northward across the Mason-Dixon line, the Ohio River to most. We then take the proceeds out of Yankee coffers, auctioning
off their federal buildings.
All the while, our new laws provide that only Confederate States citizens may vote in municipal, county/parish, state and national elections. And remember, we are deciding state by state who is and isn't a Confederate States citizen. We can afford at that time to be polite, and will call what we are doing by a politically correct Southern name; maybe Spring Cleaning Sounds kinda homelike, doesn't it?
Now there will be some lacking money to travel north who should rightfully be going in that direction. We can begin a Yankee Scholarship Fund, which would support needy scalawags on the trip north. Then there will be those who are Yankees in name only, having been devoted to our cause all along, and more will come our way. While all the northern movement is going on. remember, many Southerners, Copperheads, etc. will be coming South. Such ones we might invite to stay. But, for the northbound portion, we can expect huge traffic jams, as all the traitors and scalawags rush to leave before they get recognized by a patriotic neighbor.
When it comes to the “united nations," the Confederate States is not a member, and therefore would not need to join. We can expel all “united nations'* people, of whatever sort, and deny them diplomatic recognition, since we need only recognize representatives of established nations, not globalists. Nor do we need to recognize the European Union, since that is not a nation.
We begin negotiating with like-minded nations around the world in an effort to protect the sovereignty of all from these

globalists, seeing how many we might convince to withdraw their recognition of the “united nations." Through our taxes and import duties, we can render it cheaper to build here than over there, make industries decide which country they belong to, ours or some other, assuring that corporations benefit their own people.
What I am trying to say is that we, as Confederates, would have innumerable advantages by pursuing our liberation. Those outlined here arc only a few. One that's particularly worth mentioning is this: States will be sovereign under the Confederacy and govern all domestic affairs within their respective borders. This includes issues like abortion (yes or no), racial problems, political correctness; and the mass media would be receiving their broadcast licenses from the State, not the federal level. We can use this to break their grip on the Southland, issuing licenses to those proving loyal to their own States and the Confederacy.
Lastly, our Confederate Federal Judges, should we eventually have any, and it is likely we will, since that is provided for in our constitution: Any three States acting collectively can file charges against them for usurpation of authority as well as other charges, and they must be brought to trial.
There will be no federal welfare system or giveaways, states remaining free to do as they like. Our constitution permits expenditure of federal funds based upon “goods and services received only." Our monetary system will progressively become gold/silver backed. Knowing this is to be inevitable, we shall see investments in the

So since the eagle is to be left to represent Americanism, and some of us will not give up on this great emblem, I suggest that the new bird be a parrot.

story; Mo Dees can tell a story.99
MONTGOMERY, Sept. 24 - Today the Christian Coalition of Alabama discovered a public document containing a letter from Morris Dees of the Southern Poverty Law Center written to the Ayesha Khan, the legal director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State. The letter, dated July 16th, 2002, outlined a degrading legal strategy in regard to a lawsuit filed against Judge Roy Moore for placing a Ten Commandments Monument in the Alabama Supreme Court Building.
Morris Dees called Judge Moore a “bigot," “religious nut," and referred to Coral Ridge Ministries, founded by Dr. James Kennedy, as a “fanatical church." Dees stated, “1 also know that I am a trial lawyer and believe one of my strengths is in telling a story, at least that is what I am told. A judge is nothing more than a jury when it comes to the facts. You might remember that, from the start, I was laying our trial theme, i.e., how this was the act of a lone religious nut in partnership with a fanatical church Thi$,i$ the.story {hat will

Another “King Cotton” crop likely to develop under the Confederacy is aquaculture. Fish products and seafoods will be farmed and shipped around the world, the result being that many species now near extinction grow mightily in numbers. In all areas we will have conservation as a result, not in spite, of profit: no more complaining about all the Yankee government-inspired construction and paving which eats up valuable timber, farm and scenic lands. What is built can be unbuilt, with much of our land returned to pre-Yankee-invasion splendor. For profit! Nor shall we depend upon Arabian oil, and sometime I will write an article explaining why this is true.
Oh, and one other interesting issue: I am presupposing the Confederate States Congress will select the song “Dixie" as our National Anthem. I want to hear the Russians and Chinese attempt to sing it in their languages. I’d pay to for that!
Think about it, people: all the issues we now consider unsolvable can be dealt with in a very short time once the Confederate States of America are liberated. So many of our people differ on this subject, without realizing the enormous advantages which will come our way once we are a free and independent nation; benefits I could only touch on here! “We” will suddenly be the majority, and, when going to vote, only Confederates will be on the ballot.
Anybody interested?

Another parroted phrase which is deeply embedded in the gray matter of these non-thinkers is more reiigious; “Squawk-judge not that yc be not judged; judge not that yc be not judged....” There again, the whole history of the United States, indeed all the sons of David and Adam from the beginning were entrusted with the ability to make sound judgments, given the Highest Authority, the Scriptures, which condemn sin in the flesh and have been the ground of good juries forever. “Squawk - judge not that ye be not judged..."

Christian Coalition of Alabama President John Giles responded to this discovery by saying, “This letter outlining a legal strategy to ruin Judge Moore is degrading, irresponsible and suggests of judicial tampering. Chief Justice Roy Moore has been hailed by Alabamians as a role model public servant; he is a graduate of West Point Academy, served our country as a company commander in the Vietnam conflict and is a fine Christian husband and father. This attempt to portray Chief Justice Moore in any other way is irresponsible and untrue."
Giles further stated, “This letter leaves the impression that the federal judge has already reached a decision, which in my view has to be a misrepresentation of Judge Myron Thompson by Decs' claims." Giles concluded: “Dr. James Kennedy and Coral Ridge Ministries is one of the finest Christian ministries in the country, and has the highest degree of credibility among evangelicals.”

Abolish the Fed,
Actually abolish the Fed?
Not this year, of course, but Rep. Ron Paul's bill has laid the foundation. Before, the idea of a U.S. Congressman standing up to those mobsters wearing ties and cufflinks while dictating our money was unthinkable. Now let's boot a few of our "representatives" who still don't get it, and elect real tribunes who I understand what these two are saying.
With gold as money9 government cannot manipulate the supply:
By Ron Paul
US. Representative (R), Texas
[The U.S. House of Representatives, September JO, 2002]
Mr. Speaker, I rise to introduce legislation to restore financial stability to America's economy by abolishing the Federal Reserve. I also ask unanimous consent to insert the attached article by Lew Rockwell, president of the Ludwig Von Mises Institute, which explains the benefits of abolishing the Fed and restoring the gold standard, into the record.
Since the creation of the Federal Reserve, middle and working-class Americans have been victimized by a boom-and-bust monetary policy. In addition, most Americans have suffered a steadily eroding purchasing power because of the Federal Reserve’s inflationary policies. This represents a real, if hidden, tax imposed on the American people.
From the Great Depression to the stagflation of the seventies, to the burst of the dotcom bubble last year, every economic downturn suffered by the country over the last 80 years can be traced to Federal Reserve policy. The Fed has followed a consistent policy of flooding the economy with easy money, leading to a misallocation of resources and an artificial "boom" followed by a recession or depression when the Fed-created bubble bursts.
With a stable currency, American exporters will no longer be held hostage to an erratic monetary policy. Stabilizing the currency will also give Americans new incentives to save, as they will no longer have to fear inflation eroding their savings. Those members concerned about increasing America's exports or the low rate of savings should be enthusiastic supporters of this legislation.
Though the Federal Reserve policy harms the average American, it benefits those in a position to take advantage of the cycles in monetary policy. The main beneficiaries are those who receive access to artificially inflated money and/or credit before the inflationary effects of the policy impact the entire economy. Federal Reserve policies also benefit big spending politicians who use the inflated currency created by the Fed to hide the true costs of the welfare-warfare state. It is time for Congress to put the interests of the American people ahead of the special interests and their own appetite for big government.
Abolishing the Federal Reserve will allow Congress to reassert its constitutional authority over monetary policy. The United States Constitution grants to Congress the authority to coin money and regulate the value of the currency. The

say Ron Paul of Texas and Lew Rockwell of Alabama
Constitution does not give Congress the authority to delegate control over monetary policy to a central bank. Furthermore, the Constitution certainly does not empower the federal government to erode the American standard of living via an inflationary monetary policy.
In fact, Congress* * constitutional mandate regarding monetary policy should only permit currency backed by stable commodities such as silver and gold to be used as legal tender. Therefore, abolishing the Federal Reserve and returning to a constitutional system will enable America to return to the type of monetary system envisioned by our nation's Founders: one where the value of money is consistent because it is tied to a commodity such as gold. Such a monetary system is the basis of a true free-market economy.
In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to stand up for working Americans by putting an end to the manipulation of the money supply which erodes Americans* standard of living, enlarges big government, and enriches well-connected elites, by cosponsoring my legislation to abolish the Federal Reserve.
Why gold?
By Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
As with all matters of investment, everything is clear in hindsight Had you bought gold mutual funds earlier this year, they might have appreciated more than 100 percent. Gold has risen $60 since March 2001 to the latest spot price of $326.
Why wasn't it obvious? The Fed has been inflating the dollar as never before, driving interest rates down to absurdly low levels, even as the federal government
has been pushing a mercantile trade policy, and New York City, the hub of the world economy, continues to be threatened by terrorism. The government is failing to prevent more successful attacks by not backing down from foreign policy disasters and by not allowing planes to arm themselves. These are all conditions that make gold particularly attractive.
Or perhaps it is not so obvious why this is true. It’s been three decades since the dollar's tie to gold was completely severed, to the hosannas of mainstream economists. There is no stash of gold held by the Fed or the Treasury that backs our currency system. The government owns gold but not as a monetary asset. It owns it the same way it owns national parks and fighter planes. It's just another asset the government keeps to itself.
The dollar, and all our money, is nothing more and nothing less than what it looks like: a cut piece of linen paper with fancy printing on it. You can exchange it for other currency at a fixed rate and for any good or service at a flexible rate. But there is no established exchange rate between the dollar and gold, either at home or internationally.
The supply of money is not limited by the amount of gold. Gold is just another good for which the dollar can be exchanged, and in that sense is legally no different from a gallon of milk, a tank of gas, or an hour of babysitting services.
Why, then, do people turn to gold in times like these? What is gold used for? Yes, there are industrial uses and there are consumer uses in jewelry and the like. But recessions and inflations don't cause people
to want to wear more jewelry or stock up on industrial metal. The investor demand ultimately reflects consumer demand for gold. But that still leaves us with the question of why the consumer demand exists in the first place. Why gold and not sugar or wheat or something else?
There is no getting away from it: investor markets have memories of the days when gold was money. In fact, in the whole history of civilization, gold has served as the basic money of all people wherever it’s been available. Other precious metals have been valued and coined, but gold always emerged on top in the great competition for what constitutes the most valuable commodity of all.
There is nothing intrinsic about gold that makes it money. It has certain properties that lend itself to monetary use: portability, divisibility, scarcity, durability, uniformity. But these are just descriptors of certain qualities of the metal, not explanations as to why it became money. Gold became money for only one reason: because that’s what the markets chose.
Why isn’t gold money now? Because governments destroyed the gold standard. Why? Because they regarded it as too inflexible. To be sure, monetary inflexibility is the friend of free markets. Without the ability to create money out of nothing, governments tend to run tight financial ships. Banks are more careful about the lending when they can’t rely on a lender of last resort with access to a money-creation machine like the Fed.
A fixed money stock means that overall prices are generally more stable. The problems of inflation and business cycles disappear entirely. Under the gold standard, in fact, increased market productivity causes prices to generally decline over time as the purchasing power of money increases.
In 1967, Alan Greenspan once wrote an article called Gold and Economic Freedom. He wrote that:
An almost hysterical antagonism toward the gold standard is one issue which unites statists of all persua-
Greenspan didn't tell me we had a shipmenf coming today.
sions. They seem to sense - perhaps more clearly and subtly than many consistent defenders of laissez-faire -that gold and economic freedom are inseparable, that the gold standard is an instrument of laissez-faire and that each implies and requires the other... This is the shabby secret of the welfare statists' tirades against gold. Deficit spending is simply a scheme for the confiscation of wealth. Gold stands in the way of this insidious process. It stands as a protector of property rights.
He was right. Gold and freedom go together. Gold money is both the result of freedom and its leading protector. When money is as good as gold, the government

cannot manipulate the supply for its own purposes. Just as the rule of law puts limits on the despotic use of police power, a gold standard puts extreme limits on the government’s ability to spend, borrow, and otherwise create crazy unworkable programs. It is forced to raise its revenue through taxation, not inflation, and generally keep its house in order.
Without the gold standard, government is free to work with the Fed to inflate the currency without limit. Even in our own times, we’ve seen governments do that and thereby spread mass misery.
Now, all governments are stupid but not all are so stupid as to pull stunts like this. Most of the time, governments are pleased to inflate their currencies so long as they don’t have to pay the price in the form of mass bankruptcies, falling exchange rates, and inflation.
In the real world, of course, there is a lag time between cause and effect. The Fed has been inflating the currency at very high levels for longer than a year. The consequences of this disastrous policy are showing up only recently in the form of a falling dollar and higher gold prices. And so what does the Fed do? It is pulling back now. For the first time in nearly ten years, some measures of money (M2 and MZM) are showing a falling money stock, which is likely to prompt a second dip in the continuing recession.
Greenspan now finds himself on the horns of a very serious dilemma. If he continues to pull back on money, the economy could tip into a serious recession. This is especially a danger given rising protectionism, which mirrors the events of the early 1930s. On the other hand, a continuation of the loose policy he has pursued for a year endangers the value of the dollar overseas.
How much easier matters were when we didn't have to rely on the wisdom of exalted monetary central planners like Greenspan. Under the gold standard, the supply of money regulated itself. The government kept within limits. Banks were more cautious. Savings were high because credit was tight and saving was rewarded. This approach to economics is the foundation of a sustainable prosperity.
We don't have that system now for the country or the world, but individuals are showing their preferences once again. By driving up the price of gold, prompting gold producers to become profitable again, the people are expressing their lack of confidence in their leaders. They have decided to protect themselves and not trust the state. That is the hidden message behind the new luster of gold.
Is a gold standard feasible again? Of course. The dollar could be redefined in terms of gold. Interest rates would reflect the real supply and demand for credit. We could shut down the Fed and we would never need to worry again what the chairman of the Fed wanted. There was a time when Greenspan was nostalgic for such a system. Investors of the world have come to embrace this view even as Greenspan has completely abandoned it.
What keeps the gold standard from becoming a reality again is the love of big government and war. If we ever fall in love with freedom again, the gold standard will once more become a hot issue in public debate.

Pre-emptive self defense, not War
By Edgar J. Steele Come a little closer, huh, a-will ya, huh? Close enough to look in my eyes, Sharona keepin’ it a mystery, it gets to me... — My Sharona, written by Doug Fieger and Berton Avarre, recorded by The Knack, 1979. Gonna kick Saddam’s butt. Gonna root out terrorists. Gonna make the world safe for democracy... Whoa, you say. Starting a war is illegal under both the “u.n.” charter and the U.S. Constitution? No problem. We just call it self defense! Yeah, that’s it! We’re just defending ourselves. Don’t need to bother with them pesky congresscritters, either.
Thus has evolved George Bush’s newfound doctrine of self defense by pre-emptive strikes upon Iraq. War, it used to be called. But, America does not initiate war, by definition, so it must be something else of course. This is the latest orwellian doubletalk coming from Washington. Conjures up images of the playing cards painting the Queen’s roses red. Excuse me while I take a couple of aspirin and lay down for a while. Maybe this headache will just go away. On the other hand, maybe what we’re having is a brain aneurism. A nationwide head case is what we’ve become. Just ask almost any European.
Bush and Blair, the current sock puppets for Greater Israel’s NWO hegemonic ambitions, leaders of the free world and protectors of democracy, claim to have the goods on Saddam. As with Osama, though, the goods are not for our eyes. In feet, Blair urges, merely having established a connection between Osama and Saddam should be enough. No, we can’t be trusted with the proof of that, either.
Every time I become self-righteously indignant, because these guys actually expect us to believe this tripe, I am stunned anew by the realization that, apparently, most Americans actually do believe it! Hope springs eternal, but 1 fear that P.T.

It’s tough being among the awake in the early hours. Actually, these aren't really the early hours anymore. While an ever greater number are tumbling to what’s going on, it doesn't seem to be nearly fast enough to save the Union. Increasingly, I doubt the worth of saving it, anyway.

INDIANAPOLIS - The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) has decreed that its real mission lies not in supervising sports, but in pushing a leftist political agenda. The Association gave notice this spring that it will not grant championship athletic venues to states that prominently display Confederate imagery.
In their official news release, the NCAA said they doubted whether states that displayed the Confederate Battle Flag had “the ability...to provide a quality experience for the participants and fans and to conduct those events safely.” In short, the NCAA was accusing the people of South Carolina and Mississippi, because of the design of their state flags, of being a possible bodily threat to (presumably black) college athletes.
Perhaps the NCAA should turn its attentions toward more realistic issues on our college campuses, such as the appallingly low graduation rate of black basketball players, or the spiraling legal woes encountered by many college football players (nearly one-fourth of the Northern Arizona University football team was arrested and convicted last year). Or how about recent admissions by NBA and

Crude War looms in Iraq
The good news is that the media arefinally facing up to thefact that the primary reason for President Bush *s war against Iraq is oiL By Christopher Bollyn
From American Free Press, 1433 Pennsylvania Av SE. Washington. DC 20003. Subscriptions $59 per year.
Ignore the human costs of the Iraqi war and the S2OO-S2S0 billion that the United States would have to spend of taxpayers* money to attack the Middle East country. The outcome of the war could be a bonanza for American and British oil companies.
America's warmongering is fueled by greed - the immense profits Big Oil will realize when Iraq is conquered. That’s why the administration is determined to make war even though Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein has already surrendered to U.S. demands.
The war rationale had been that Saddam had thrown out the United Nation’s inspectors.
Hussein capitulated and told the UN, by letter, that inspectors could return with no conditions attached.
However, the administration still wants war and has sought a resolution from Congress rubber-stamping its plans.
“A U.S.-led ouster of President Saddam Hussein could open a bonanza for American oil companies,” a recent Washington Post article said, and scuttle huge oil deals between Baghdad and Russia, France, and other countries.
Petroleum experts estimate that Iraq may possess more than 330 billion barrels of oil - making it the richest oil reserve in the world.	^
The Post article, “When it’s over, who gets the oil?” was a front-page story in the International Herald Tribune on Sept. 16.
The article suggests that the administration of President Bush is already using the promise of Iraqi oil profits as future spoils of war to force reluctant countries to support
a U.S. and British-led invasion of Iraq.
The article, however, failed to mention the most lucrative spoils: Iraq’s estimated 330 billion barrels of probable oil reserves.
“It’s pretty straightforward,” said former CIA director R. James Woolsey, one of the leading war hawks calling for “regime change” in Iraq. “France and Russia have oil companies and interests in Iraq. They should be told that if they are of assistance in moving Iraq toward decent government, we’ll do the best we can to ensure that the new government and American companies work closely with them.
“If they throw in their lot with Saddam, it will be difficult to the point of impossible to persuade the new Iraqi government to work with them,” Woolsey said.
Since the Gulf War in 1991, companies from more than a dozen nations, including France, Russia, China, India, Italy, Vietnam and Algeria, have negotiated to develop Iraqi oil fields, refurbish existing facilities or explore undeveloped tracts. Most of the deals are on hold pending the lifting of UN sanctions, which would occur when a new government is installed.
The Russians have recently signed a proposed $40 billion economic agreement with Iraq that reportedly includes opportunities for Russian companies to explore for oil in Iraq’s western desert where extensive probable reserves are being explored.
The French company Total Fina Elf has negotiated for rights to develop the huge Majnoon field, near the Iranian border, estimated at 30 billion barrels of oil.
These agreements, however, would be worthless if a new Iraqi government, installed by the U.S. and British forces, tears them up.
The U.S. and British governments support the Iraqi National Congress (INC), an organization of Iraqi opposition groups, which may replace the current government in Baghdad. Officials from the INC say they will not be bound by any existing deals
if and when they are installed in power.
“We will review all these agreements, definitely,” said Faisal Qaragholi, a petroleum engineer who directs the London office of the U.S.-backed organization of opposition groups that is backed by the United States. “Our oil policies should be decided by a government in Iraq elected by the people.”
Ahmed Chalabi, the INC leader, spoke as if he had already been elected and said he favored the creation of a U.S.-led consortium to develop Iraq’s oil fields, according to the Post. “American companies will have a big shot at Iraqi oil,” Chalabi said.
“Administration officials have been unwilling to talk about the specific costs of a war, preferring to discuss the removal of Mr. Hussein in foreign-policy or even moral terms,” The Wall Street Journal's Bob Davis wrote. “Discussing the economics of the war could make it seem as if the U.S. were going to war over oil. That would sap support at home and abroad, especially in the Middle East, where critics suspect the U.S. of wanting to seize Arab oil fields.”
The cost of the planned U.S.-led war in Iraq would be primarily borne by U.S. taxpayers because, unlike the Gulf War of 1991 in which allies paid $48 billion of the $58 billion total, there are no allies willing to contribute to the war effort other than Britain and Israel.
If Iraq has a “long history of playing games,” Britain has an even longer history of meddling in Iraqi affairs.
The nation of Iraq was created from the conquered Mesopotamian provinces of the defeated Ottoman Empire by Britain after World War I.
Iraq was occupied by British troops from 1919 to 1932. During the occupation, Iraqis were not allowed to govern their own affairs and Indians were used as administrators.
Christopher Bollyn. Vince Ryan and ! the entire staff of a very brave weekly tabloid which picked up the pieces of the plutocrat-destroyed Spotlight,
| please accept this token of appreciation for having carried on with objective journalism where so many have failed.
Britain actually drew Iraq’s boundaries and installed the first king of Iraq, as it did in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere in the region.
While the recent history and immense oil wealth of Iraq is relevant to the current issue of war, the mainstream media tends to ignore it. CNN and BBC reach millions and have focused intently on Iraq but have avoided discussing its history or immense oil wealth. CNN International is sponsored by the oil giants Royal Dutch Shell and British Petroleum (BP), which has absorbed Amoco and ARCO.
AFP asked the commercial television network BBC World if the fact that Chevron, Texaco and Shell were corporate sponsors had influenced their decision not to discuss Iraq’s oil reserves. BBC World spokesman Ciara O'Sullivan said that the editorial content was “completely independent.”
The immense oil wealth of Iraq “is going to be the big story,” O’Sullivan said. It is a “major debate that is going to bubble UP-"___________________________________□

I would also like to send it to my families, brother, sisters, children, etc, around the country to let them try to get their local papers to print it I just thought it was excellent. I deeply appreciate what you are attempting to do, and I plan to vote as you recommend in the upcoming election. By the way, are you aware of Cynthia McKinney of Atlanta? She is a Congresswoman and one with 100% courage. She has spoken strongly about conducting an investigation into the sinking of the USS Liberty by Israel in 1967 with 40 U.S. sailor lives lost and 170 wounded. There has never been an investigation of why all this happened. She had also called for an in-depth investigation of the World Trade Center fiasco. So, in the Georgia primary, the Jewish lobby brought in piles of money and got her opponent elected. Unfortunately, she was one of just two or three congressmen or women with any guts at all. Now she is gone. I happen to be one of those who believe the Israelis had much to do with the 9-11 events.

INVADING BILOXI 1 honed in on these last two paragraphs: “Eugene Bryant, the NAACP’s state president, said he is disappointed with the Businessmen’s Club’s vote. However, he said, his organization remains committed to working out the dispute at the negotiating table. ‘We have a lot of other businessmen, and the whole religious community in Harrison County, on our side,’ Bryant said. 'It comes down to whether Harrison County is a Confederate state or not.*” Well, Mr. Bryant said it, and Mr. Bryant meant it; but what Mr. Bryant said just ’taint so. A county, a state? Hah! Excuse me, but I’ll copy Scrooge and say: “Bah. Humbug!” as humbug is what his words amount to. Divisive? Who’s trying to be divisive? ’Pears as though Mr. Bryant wants to divide people and their appropriate pride from a flag that, to them and many others, represents honor, honesty, courage and freedom from oppression. If Mr. Bryant wants to dream up other negative meanings for that flag, so be it. If he wants to delve in hate instead of love for fellow man, again that’s his choice. Hopefully his tarnished feelings will be wiped clean and someday he may join his fellow men in love, not hate; and, instead of creating divisiveness, become a “peacemaker” (in the terms of Matthew 5:9 as opposed to the terms of the “united nations”).

JUDICIAL MISRULE In response to the unconstitutional court decision of the Santa Fe High School ban on the Confederate Battle Flag: The court ruling was wrong, bad wrong! The First Amendment “free speech” right is primary, absolute, and not contingent on the choice of others to be “offended.” It is not secondary to fabricated racial tensions, “diversive” divisiveness, “potential” disruption, “perceived” hurt feelings, nor “threats” of unlawful violence. The right to petition for a redress of grievance requires the burden of proof by the “offended” complainant, if any. Semper Fi and Deo Vindice.	JOE	M.	MILLER

ONE DAY WITHOUT YOKE I have been contemplating the email [Alabama Moratorium, 9-9-02] for some time now. I don’t think I understand it Arc you telling me that on some future date, taxes will be suspended in Alabama for a day? If so, when? It has not been, to the best of my knowledge, and will not be, I am certain, publicized by the liberal media.
DENNIS WIGGINS By email
|A good start at thinking; but, as with most of us, thoughts conditioned by the same media which you most certainly know won't support any tax cut I did not say taxes will self-suspend, but that a few informed Alabamians should stop paying them that day. Because I can’t find better words, let me borrow from those tax-and-spenders: The longest journey begins with a first step. -Ed.|
I have already declared to the Infernal Revenue arm of the private international banking institute known as the Federal Reserve that I no longer wish to volunteer. I have stopped paying a “user fee” to those that attempt to control me, so what more should I do? I wrote a Writ of Habeas Corpus for my Liberty right to travel. All the political scumbags and thought police officers would have me in their private jails. So I will continue about my business quietly, thanks. “Damn” Yankee Patriot, JAMES STAUFENBERG By email
UHHHHHHHh, excuse me, but isn’t Tax Freedom Day sometime along in May or after? I live in Alabama, but thought it was the same across the nation. The federal income tax we all pay they’ve been keeping track of, and the last I heard it was in May. But a friend said that is long short, now it is even later than that. Maybe in this instance there’s no one “out to violently overthrow Leviathan,” but unconstitutional Leviathan needs to be violently overthrown! Fat chance of any from the major two party slop in D.C. doing anything about it, though! They are all a bunch of wimps enjoying their “cushie” seats while making it cushier!	MARYANN	CRUM

(Tax Freedom Day varies because it includes federal, state and local taxes. But it would be around this time of year if you include “Yes Mommy” workplace safety requirements, mandatory reports, taxes on manufactures and transports, licenses, compulsory insurance, etc., none of which applies to NAFTA or Made in China. -Ed)
TRUTH AT LAST
Just got the latest hard copy - looks grand - your riposte to the SCV included. Good to see virtue mentioned already in the fifth line on the first page. Holy jump up and sit down, it’s raining truth! By the way. The First Freedom is now the Southern Heritage newspaper of record. Appreciate your page 2 monthly news roundup, and find I can’t part with my copies any more because I may need to refer to them one or ten years down the road.	NELSON	WALLER

Do you have about five or six copies of this [9-02] issue still? I have some folks I want to give it to. Might get a subscription out of it for you. Also I can pay for them too; just send the bill. This issue says some things I can’t say but you can.
AUSTIN RAINWATERS Mobile, AL
Congratulations on your continued defense of the principle of freedom of thought and expression. I’m beginning to understand why you named the publication The First Freedom. You take that freedom quite seriously and literally. The scope of articles ranges from local to international, and the common element in all of them seems to be an effort to express the truth as seen by the writer. This publication is to be commended, and is a heartening feature in a world of publications which practically all have only one view of current events. I especially appreciated the article on “ugly facts” by “Birdman Bryant” in the latest issue — ugly indeed, but facts nonetheless. Regards,	TYRONE	CROWLEY

NEW ALABAMA ORDER The Sorensen Family is now under threat of arrest, religious persecution, and intrusion by Alabama Governor Don Siegelman and Colonel James Alexander, Director of Alabama Department of Public Safety. Siegelman and Alexander may be committing the crime of sedition in failing to uphold, protect and defend the Constitutions. (Noah Webster’s 1828 Dictionary: “Sedition - A factious commotion of the people, or a tumultuous assembly of men rising in opposition to law or the administration of justice, and in disturbance of the public peace ” No longer do these public servants operate under, or abide by, either the Constitution of Alabama or of the United States of America, the supreme law of the land. Those failing to uphold their oaths of office should be removed from them at the earliest possible date and tried for such crimes against the people.
HAROLD SORENSEN Rutledge
[I cannot see that any good will come from public officials simply dismissing Mr. Harold Sorensen’s pleas for justice. The rights of all are violated when such misfeasance passes unnoticed. No law requires a Social Security number for him to live or work in the U.S., yet these officials demand one as a precondition for his Alabama Driver License. If you are unaware of the facts, ask for prior articles detailing the Sorensen case. It is the duty of our legislature to take action when courts and public officers are not performing their duties. -Ed.]

SAVE THE CHILDREN A story from my hometown. 1 used to walk to Aycock School to catch the bus. My mother has an article in the cornerstone of the building which was laid in 1922. My sister went to school there. All over the South the monuments and memorials were mostly put up by the efforts of the United Daughters of the Confederacy. Now they are being eliminated from that role by an “educational" system that is more indoctrination than education.

The Rev. McGrail's letter entitled “Equal Justice For All” implies that such equality does not exist for minorities, and goes as far as recommending “sensitivity training” for certain persons in law enforcement.
The most memorable case in recent history involved a minority man, who murdered two white people. It was a cold blooded, premeditated slaughter, and the perpetrator is now free and enjoying golf on the public links.
Terminal Phase
One must either eventually accept Big Brother’s benevolence and be swept along before this orwellian nightmare, or awaken to the fact that the emperor has no clothes. Those capable of rousing themselves out of the media-induced hypnosis must confront such indoctrinated opinion, and declare the truth. But let us pity the poor derelicts of "public education” who’ve been rendered suspicious of the latent strength within their divided and conquered minds.
Time is the greatest healer, always has been; the fevered brains of “intellectual” tailors to the king will cool. But how long must we wait? Pessimists sense they won’t live to see today's burgeoning government bureaucracy/mediacracy unmasked for what it is; yet the more optimistic among us take heart from the fact that the U.S.S.R. at one time had been decorated in finery, medals galore, feather in hat for each space triumph, the future given over to a regal potentate. Now this emperor stands naked, the clothes-makers are seen as a retinue of thieves, and his former "republics” declare their independence. All it took was one man of clear vision, true leader of the hour and a gutsy challenger. U.S. President Ronald Reagan, noted Margaret Thatcher, won the cold war singlehandedly without firing a shot “Tear down that wall!” he said, and the stones caging up communist East Berlin came tumbling down.
The blocks and razor wire had been real, only the media myths and their dandified ideology fake. Our “Great Communicator” wasn't alone in such opinion. All having opened their eyes wept for joy. Yet some still don't get it.
Seeing is believing? Behold the miracle about you! But never dismiss the myopic “intellectual” behind that curtain of many colors and walls, for he is the media: the micro-manager of politicians, intruder into everyone’s personal affairs. If you would live self-governed and free, unmolested when celebrating your own clothing and heritage, symbols and religion, and remain at liberty to guide your children in the paths of private choice, always remember that in order to preserve our rights we must exercise them.
That calls for action: individuals, states and communities protecting and advancing their own interests after consulting with the indigenous elders, bowing to God but no imperator. For the latter can only increase his powers as the people submit to uniform direction. Today’s mediacrats promote the leveling by calling such oblivion diversity, yet shriek in concert when some individual challenging their myths gains an audience; so, you can imagine the tumult that any true variety, e.g., a popularly constituted Tax Moratorium Day, would arouse once their initial silence on the matter fails. By the way, twenty-four hours of resistance wasn’t my idea. Rome’s tribunes, the first tribal representatives, were seated only following a taxpayer exodus into the hills lasting much longer. If Tennessee revolts for a whole week, by comparison we’ll be moderates.
The naked emperor must exit posthaste once we citizens firmly reassert our views and values. And it’s high time to throw that resistance right in the face of the arrogant
had sensitivity training
I refer to the O. J. Simpson case.
To refresh you, Rev. McGrail, the fix was in even before the minority-ridden defense, the minority-ridden prosecution, and the minority judge began the trial. Los Angeles, that former great city turned urban disaster through “multiculturalism,” wanted no repeat of the billion-dollar Rodney King riot, with its loss of fifty-three lives.
Instead of holding the trial in Santa Monica, where Brentwood crimes are supposed to be tried and the jury pool is overwhelmingly white. District Attorney Gil Garcetti moved the case downtown. On the slight chance that O. J. might be found
guilty, the verdict could then be blamed on a largely black jury.
Despite all the evidence presented that proved beyond any reasonable juror’s reasonable doubts that O. J. was indeed guilty as sin, no black juror could dutifully cast a guilty vote and then return to his or her ghetto and face his or her brothers and sisters.
The pretrial wheeling and dealing in the Simpson case amounted to an outright perversion of our legal system, and it led inexorably to one of the great perversions of justice in our time.
Equal justice, indeed. ED TONER

mediacracy. The eternal vigilance invoked by Thomas Jefferson calls for vision now. Otherwise, a long wait - for this timorous dreamland to play out its fantasies and the central planners be exposed in their own former media - will consume the better days of our quick generation.
The One World orderlies are losers, and all who have better plans for their lives are turning off the PCTV. Following upon that very important first step, the liberated soul rapidly learns to gather information and entertainments untainted with subterfuge.
To others of less wit, such compatriots are ridiculing the pageant unnecessarily. A few will always need some kind of nanny, caretaker, or Director of Daily Decisions paraded in splendid attire. The hopeless are irritated by any attention to their pitiful, sedentary lives, totally ignorant of existing under close scrutiny by those manipulating every couch potato’s thought processes. These just want to be entertained, amused, enthralled and delighted, never thinking of themselves as the lotus-eaters encountered there on Fantasia Channel by Odysseus. It’s so peaceful in this lounge of perpetual forgetfiilness: why bother with anything?
Sadly, many who admit the hypocrisy of political correctness — even going so far as to allow their expressed opinions have been largely fabricated by others contrary to the voice within, souls that know and love their heritage - will simply capitulate. “Hey, what can anybody do about it? A tidal wave can’t be stopped! If you can't beat ’em, join ’em.” Whether the eye or ear is assaulted (and more often it’s both), such is the shallowness of bang-bang.
Our heroes aren’t quitters. Odysseus paid his dues to the regiment at Troy, but then ventured on to explore the world. Fighting Joe Wheeler, Davis, Jackson and Lee didn’t linger when dignity called the Confederate President to one office and the best of military leaders to others, all of them performing their duties. Each would have been nothing if not inspired to behave as circumstances dictated: a sovereign in full. It’s no different today, folks. Where lesser men and races recoil from nature’s fierceness, the gallant take up her aegis, build faithfully under eternal law and never dally when the preservation of one’s virtue calls for exile from those who will not see.
The couch commandoes won't be easy proselytes. But then we redemptors might point out to them that an online taxpayer capable of surviving without PCTV for, say, six days a week should still find no shortage of entertainment. Human beings are presumably more clever than rats that know to abandon a sinking ship. Those who boycott the mediacracy will, at least passively, influence its underwriters to seek less controversial advertising forums.
The mind of this universe has surely not given us these myriad problems to suffer, but to solve! Renewal, faith’s fountain and the essence of life, can only pour out from chaos, uncertainty and strife. Sorry, New World orderlies, but you’re “it.” We need you: the sane man’s burden.
Those unholy opinion-makers, today at the height of their powers, are unwilling to see because no less blind than the ones they would lead. But there's no getting under,
vault full of papers and pretty jewelry nor fake sincerity buys back one lost moment. The surviving film makers are due to find themselves serving a very choosy market.
Much of the stuff coming to the living room wallscreen will unfold an historical drama of almost unbelievable dimensions: the untold story of what really happened, worldwide, in the century of The Big Lie. For smart young producers eager to make their marks by seizing the theme boldly, it promises to become a wide open field of opportunity whose industrious pioneers can own the turf awhile. And if their film crews and actors, at first blush, become disoriented reading the documented scripts of such politically incorrect grave drama, the financial backers may also need to be adventurous natures. I’m talking here about our first substantial leaps of faith up and out of this Slough of Despond.
But won’t those initial promoters have a monumental selling job? Certainly, and in carrying out their duties each of them will move spiritedly as circumstances dictate. Timing is everything; it will happen.
Not even our intrepid scouts of online democracy can be fully prepared for this complete reversal, one hundred fifty years of court historians all corrected at once. We must anticipate the entire truth to be a little off-putting, when finally arrived into the information age, for everyone.
Irretrievably hoist by its own petard, Hollywood without doubt will evasively plead innocence: its barons were following the written accounts.
Which writers, what records? Hem! Can't we be friends?
Not a chance. Your old hierarchy is to punt no more; but then there’s always the porno market.
New-era film makers will be quick to capitalize on all historic matters having dramatic appeal; the personal computer’s delegated reviewer, and not some “ratings expert” lacking credentials, acting as the filter of choice — so that citizens can call desired products to the screen with a click and never be disappointed.
We shall before long have a touchplate capable of distinguishing any single user’s fingertips from all others. In the meantime, many homes may have hooked up with an inexpensive proxy whose internally-coded exchanges with their communication bases automatically provide interesting program catalogues reflecting earlier selections and objections: say, news or entertainment by subject range, music by class, merchandise by price group, discussions by interests, school books by grade, politics by party, foreign contacts by language, etc. Really good service that does all the above while screening out advertising and viruses will cost more at first, less later.
The customer might call a selection to the wallscreen at his convenience, perhaps an episode of the continuing Soviet Union dramatizations depicted in lurid detail: a story chosen by historical time frame and the producer's reputation, or by country, ethnicity, moral instruction, age-relevant appeal, whatever. And, if the fare turns out otherwise than as described by your agent, he loses a subscriber.
World orderlies! Those desperate attempts to structure my life in minutest detail and spend all my savings in the process having taught me to practice resistance, you got my hackles up; I’m so bold as to tell Bill Gates what we AlaRebs will settle for.
Let us demand choices: but not those the media polls and their propaganda offer. By reason of discrimination (a real word), we know we’re not “racists,” a media term, just because the first word “offends” them. Why have I not been to the movies in years? Fifty flicks condemning Hitler and never a mention of Stalin or Mao was enough, thank you. New World orderlies.
I'm waiting for one on the cold-blooded, calculated destruction of 100 million lives, some by neck-shots in those foul-smelling dungeons, others marched out to be axed or machine-gunned alongside the graves they had been forced to dig, countless numbers hung, hundreds bulldozed off into the earth where Stalin’s backward behemoth could get both fuel and dozier to the execution grounds. All these atrocities, and still more scores of silent-scream personal dramas, discoveries awaiting the producer’s art at his convenience plus this partaker's call, might be difficult to grasp in any age, much of it tough to stomach even at our present remove - a history lesson from which the wise should have taken heed whether or not ever-recurring fools keep embracing their utopian pretensions at the same time unknowingly begging acquiescent nature for an encore. True, the facts might annoy somebody. And yet, the PCTV audience is rather amply conditioned to in-your-face blood-and-violence, isn’t it? Should we become uncomfortable, then, with the communism story?
And why docs Shoah Business deliver, here in the land that had nothing to do with it, an unsolicited “Holocaust Museum” for which I’m continually billed whether or not interested in sitting through all this for the fifty-first time?
Many lose their ability to discriminate between culpability by default (their own) and the plight of other billions who never enjoyed the fortunes these potatoes have regarded so lightly - to have been-bom Americans. It’s the same old story; that which isn’t earned is not appreciated, the more so where disinformation is shoved in your face from childhood. All are creatures of habit.
Just by degrees have the brainwashed been manipulated into such horrendously submissive thought patterns, this mewling political correctness: reticence to speak out with meaningful, original opinions. Thus, only incrementally can we hope to regain our capacity for sovereign thought. The first steps are essential. A do-or-dic agenda will be mentioned shortly. For now. let's observe that many are at last resolved to cease being had by those clowns pushing “compassion” for their latest "victims” rampaging everywhere. We will not give up the constitution, nor hear more about universal brotherhood. If you ask which constitution - it’s a Southern thang, y'all wouldn't understand. Our time has come. We’re tired of it.
