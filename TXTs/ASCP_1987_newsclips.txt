Opposes county manager
As usual, the politicians who we are guilty of electing look for ways to spend the “slush funds” created by excessively high taxes. So they now talk about appointing a county manager. No, we would not elect such a dictator and would have no control over him or her.
If the commissioners cannot handle their jobs, they should resign. We can look in the direction of our retired citizens to handle the part-time jobs of our county. -- ^

The radical forces united and forced Judg Robert Bork not to be seated on our Supreme' Court. With the ruling that permits the com-! munists to freely come and go, to contact such slime in America, we realize more than! ever our need for Judge Bork on our Supreme! Court.	.	w
More than ever, the voters must request a{ copy of how all senators voted regarding] Judge Robert Bork’s failing to be approved.' After which, each voter across our nation will! know who to vote against next election.
Those with short memories keep the copy^i which can be obtained “free” from the pre^j sent senators in Washington, D.C.
Be sure to write and request the same. Do! yourself and future generations a big favor) for freedoms of the future, which cost much* life blood, r- i0(7—i‘
