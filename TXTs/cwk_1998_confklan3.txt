BURNING COMMUNIST FLAG
Longtime Alabama Pro-Majority Activist Mr. William Burchfield was recently
arrested, along with two associates, for burning a Communist, mexican, and United Nations flags at a anti-immigration demonstration in Cullman, Alabama. Mr. Burchfield is taking this fight to court, we believe this is a clear First Amendment violation.
How many times have we seen foreigners, Reds, and niggers on TV burning the American or Confederate Battle Flag? and were they arrested? Hell No !
Down with every alien-Zionist one world flag and up with the Stars and Bars!
Brother Burchfield needs our support to win this battle in court, all donations will be appreciated very much, send to: William Burchfield
