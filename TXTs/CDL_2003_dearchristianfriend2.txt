October 2003
Dear Christian Friend:
We’re still in the process of sorting out around 4,000 booklets which were hurled from our bookshelves when an individual smashed into our Church building in July.
We hope to be able to get the contractors started on the repair work within a few days. This means that we will NOT have the use of our book department for at least 10 days, so any orders will be temporarily delayed, as when the repairs are finished shelves will have to be restocked.
The October issue is enclosed. In an effort to increase our circulation, we have rented several patriotic mailing lists. Chances are that vou mav be on one of those lists, so if you are a paid up subscriber and receive a notice encouraging you to subscribe, keep this in mind.
Hopefully, we should be in a position to start sample copy mailings in about 15 days.
In September I was on international short wave radio, and the enthusiasm and response from listeners was encouraging. I want to also let you know that Jim Taylor has also been on several talk shows and is doing a great job.
Will keep you posted on our building repairs and our efforts to have charges brought against the culprit who ran his car into our building and why he did it and if so for whom?
Contributions and subscription renewals keep us going, and any help you can give us is [ greatly appreciated.
Sincerely,!
r Jaimes KL Warner
