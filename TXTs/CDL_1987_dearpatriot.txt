Dear Patriot:
We're moving ahead with all our prompts. As you can see from the last few issues of the CDL REPORT, we're keeping you completely informed on events taking place in South Africa.
As things happen in that country we're receiving air mailed reports which are then edited for the CDL REPORT.
The December issue of the CDL REPORTtwill have information on a new political organization that has been formed in South Africa and information on what the other groups stand for and are doing at this time.
In October we met with Ma j . Gen. Otto Ernst Remer, and conducted a four hour exclusive interview with him. As many of you know, Gen. Remer stopped a major pld>t against Hitler in 1944 and arrested the conspirators. After that he became a key advisor to Hitler on a number of problems. In our interview with him, he goes into detail on many questions pondered on by historians but never answered to date.
The interview was conducted in German and is now in the process of being transcribed from tapes and translated.
Gen. Remer is one of the key patriotic politicians in West Germany and because of his patriotic views has spent several years in exile in Arab countries. To his advantage, Gen. Remer was NEVER a member of the Nazi Party or SS and has thus been able to speak out more on the war than any other politican of that era. Even so, his home has been raided by the "Democratic" thought police and when in the 40's (after the war) when he formed the Socialist Reich Party and elected three men to the German Bundestag (parliament) the "Democrats" responded by banning his party and issuing an arrest warrant for him.
At 75, Remer has a large following in Germany, especially among young people and he keeps up his hard hitting campaign.
Also, interviewed was August Klapprott who was the last Leader of the German American Bund. Mr. Klapprott was arrested and tried for "Sedition" in World War II and had his citizenship revoked. He was interviewed on cassette tape and this will be available in the near future.
In the past I’ve told our readers just how important your old books are. I've spent literally many thousands of dollars in travel and in purchasing books that patriots should have in print. Through Sons of Liberty we have over 700 of our booklets in print. These have come from at least 15 libraries of patriots. Most of them are books from 1900 to 1955.
r
*
We have a library of over 7,000 items including books, booklets, * I leaflets, etc. As time goes on we plan to get many of these old right wing classics back into print.
In BOOKS IN PRINT several Jewish "Revisionist" publishing houses have books we’ve located (and they purchased through us) "in print" from $59.00 to $79.00 (believe it or not for 10 to 12 page booklets!!!) and we still have them listed for mass distribution from $1.50 to $2.00!!!
Old time patriot, Conrad Grieb, recently placed his collection of patriotic material, dating from the 30's in the hands of a key revisionist scholar. Thanks to this dedicated patriot I was able to go through the material and borrow several booklets that I plan to get into print.
Among the books found was a very rare item, HATE THE ENEMY OF PEACE by Francis Neilson. His booklet is a reply to the hate filled anti-German propagandist, Lord Vansittart.
As many of you know, in the future approximately 60% of all American homes will have VHS cassette players. Since we are all but banned from the radio and TV this is an excellent chance for us to PRODUCE interview movies for new people. , In this effort, I have made a special trip to the East Coast and located a professional TV producer (who works with VHS production) who will travel to Louisiana to give selected supporters and employees of the CDL instructions (seminar) on how to film, edit and produce TV movies in a professional quality manner just like the TV studios. We also have one of our staff members who will be trained in this and be conducting professional interviews with right wing personalities WORLD WIDE and putting these interviews on VHS tapes for distribution to our people.
We will be able to conduct interviews in English, German,
Afrikaans, Dutch, French and Portuguese. Those in foreign languages will be either narrated or have English sub titles on them!!!
To get the ball rolling I have taken steps to purchase, on credit. our "get started" VHS Camcorder which will allow us to get started on our movie production. I hope to have things moving ahead in December. Beside this initial VHS we also need another for our reporters to use overseas.	-	\
\ \
These Camcorders plus other equipment and cost of the instruction \ \I
will be expensive----but a necessary step in winning this fight. We must j \
also have the funds to pay new staff members who are doing research	V
work and lining up interviews.	1
We’re making a great deal of progress and we need your help to	)
make this project successful.
Please let us hear from you by return mail.
P.S. Those who contribute $25 this month will receive HATE: THE ENEMY Cfr PEACE by Francis Neilson. Out of print since 1944!!!
Those who make a special effort to help us with our VHS Video project and contribute $50 or more will receive HATE: THE ENEMY OF PEACE plus ZIONIST TERRORISM a new report by Dr. Coleman. In this report Dr. Coleman pulls out all the stops on Zionist/Israeli terrorism world wide, naming names, events, etc. A report every patriot should have.
It is in either cassette or written format. JKW
P.P.S. Over the past 30 years we have tried to compile the most complete library of patriotic books and booklets from the earliest times to 1955. We now have over 7,000 items but still have many gaps to fill in.
If anyone reading this letter has any material printed BEFORE 1955. they would like to contribute to our library, it would be greatly appreciated, (no government reports and only magazines and newspapers before 1945)
If you have individual items or several items you would like to SELL to us then please send us a list of the material you have and if we need the material we will make you an offer. We do not want materia we already have. However, you may have material of a revisionist ’ nature which many people are looking for and SHOULD be in print, so please write to us on this. Thanks. JKW
