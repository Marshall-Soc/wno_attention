SOUTHERN THINKING
By Howard Bobbitt
As editor and published of Racewatch I have decided to follow Southern Thinking in this and all future issues. I am Southern bom and Southern bred, so I shouldn’t have any trouble in thinking Southern.
in my way of thinking, all white men and women the world over who believe in saving the White Race are true Southerners. Consequently, Southern Nationalism goes far beyond the confines of the American South. This Southern thinking is found in all 50 states and to some degree in many foreign countries. It is this type of thinking that makes us all Southerners, regardless of where we live.
So, I am asking all Southern thinking people the world over to focus on South U.S.A. and give us your support and loyalty. We intend to rid the South through political action of the forces destroying the White Race.
My prayers are with all of you during the Thanksgiving and Christmas Holidays, the most sacred season of the year for White Americans.

COMMUNISM IS A JEWISH CONSPIRACY TO MIX,
MONGRELIZE,
AND MURDER THE WHITE RACE
The Communist jews came for the Russians (1917). I did not speak up, because I was not a Russian.
Then they came for the Finlanders (1939). I was not a Finlander, so I did not speak up.
Then they came for the Germans WWII — using the combined armed might of the U.S.A. and the United Kingdom. I was not a German, so I did not speak up.
Then they came for the Arabs (1948). I did not speak up, because I was not an Arab.
Then they came for the Hungarians (1956). And I did not speak up, because I was not a Hungarian.
Then they came for the White Youth of America (1960's). I was too busy with my six-pack of beer and Sunday afternoon football game to notice what they were doing to my precious children.
Then they came for the jobs of the White man (1970's) to give them to the non-whites. Being a White man, I commenced to wake up.
Then they came for the leaders of those small groups opposed to tyranny. I was not a leader, so I didn’t speak up.
By this time, it was quite obvious that they would be coming for all white men by 1984. It's 2:00 A.M. — hear that knock on the door?

The attack on Southern White People and Southern Traditions continue. It has come to the attention of The Confederate Knights that a movie will soon be released entitled “Ghosts of Mississippi.” This movie is based on the life of Medgar Evers,
Every White Person should find out the facts about this movie. If the past is any indication, historical facts will be thrown to the wind.
If necessary — protest in some peaceful and non-violent manner.
BYRON DELA BECKWITH VI.
Byron Dela Beckwith, VI. Is imprisoned in Mississippi for a crime he denies committing. There are many other Americans who also believe that he is an innocent and framed man.
In 1963, black activist Medgar Evers was shot and killed in Jackson Mississippi. Two police officers testified in two 1964 trials that Beckwith was in his hometown of Greenwood, Mississippi the night of the shooting. In 1969 because jurors failed to reach a verdict the charge against him was dropped.
In 1993 Beckwith was again arrested, tried, and this time found guilty by a predominantly black jury. He remains in prison.
Beckwith’s only hope for release is a pardon by Governor Kirk Fondice, PO Box 139, Jackson, Mississippi. 39205 Phone: 1-601-359-3150 FAX: 1-601-359-3741.
RACEWATCH urges aii readers and supporters to contact or write Governor Fondice asking that he release Byron Dela Beckwith, VI.

There exist today within the White Race a special and very urgent need to understand our planned destruction. Sadly, and regrettably, only a few Whites, up until now, have had die will power, courage, foresight, and self-motivation to find out the facts which are causing the White Race to self-destruct.
THE CONFEDERATE KNIGHTS OF THE KU KLUX KLAN is growing and dedicated group of White Men and White Women who believe in God and Christian Identity and are working tirelessly with racial truths to expose the enemies of our race.
THE CONFEDERATE KNIGHTS OF THE KU KLUX KLAN is a non-violent, active, and disciplined White Patriots Movement
The White Race must survive! Greed, love of money, nor lies of our enemies will stop die KU KLUX KLAN. We seek a lawful and constitutional victory for the White Race. THE VICTORY MUST BE THE TOTAL SEPARATION OF THE RACES.
