You are holding in your hands, arguably, the most revealing, hence important, piece of paper in America today. Our assumed freedoms and corresponding lifestyles are slipping through our fingers and most Americans are clueless. However, the generations-old trail and well-calculated plans of our would-be captors is becoming more exposed with its character best described as diabolical and sinister. There is a ravenous monster that is loose and won't be satiated until we, "the little people", are minutely monitored, completely subdued and meekly enslaved on the Global Plantation. The prize is not money. It's absolute power and total control — of your religion, family, education, government, career, health, finances, values, etal. It is proposed to be trumpeted in via a socialist welfare police state. Beware of The Iron Fist in the Velvet Glove which caresses as it strangles. Expect the best. Prepare for the worst. Pray for Divine Guidance. Am I an alarmist? You betcha! Other labels include "dissident", Constitutionalist, "subversive", Sovereign, and "extremist".
WHAT: The final stages of the New World Order agenda are here and now. This evil conspiracy began generations ago and has greatly accelerated recently. It has been very precise with highly predictable results and barely detectable due to its subtlety and compartmentalization. Wake up, American Compatriots of kindred minds! Bless be the tie that binds. WHY: Since the beginning of society, there has been a struggle, overtly and covertly, for world dominion. Manipulation of laws and money, with greed being the prime motivator, is the most effective and efficient mode of destruction for the reconstruction. Up to now, the modus operandi has run smoothly, much to the delight of The Sinister Ones and the demise of The Ignorant Ones. However, The Line has now been drawn in the sand and the winner takes all.
WHO: The Hunted—the general populace. The Hunters—Bilderberg Group, Trilateral Commission, Council on Foreign Relations, House of Rothschild, J.P. Morgan Empire, Rockefeller Family, Kissinger, corrupt federal and state officials, international banksters, multi-national corporations, many "think-tanks" and foundations (philanthropies can be slick PR), Federal Reserve System, establishment media, the notorious alphabet gang (IRS, FBI, CIA, NSA, FDA, DEA, BATF, FEMA, ad nauseum), etc. Most employees are ignorant of The Plan and are unwittingly used as pawns in this evil morass. WHERE: The New World Order is designed to be implemented globally. The collapse and subsequent acquisition of our beloved USA is an integral step. The Plan is to have our country divided into ten regions. Consider yourself warned!! HOW: This is a very broad and deep subject to put into limited space. •“ Money = Power. On the back of a 1 FRAUD (Federal Reserve Accounting Unit Dollar, unbacked by gold), under the pyramid, reads *NOVUS ORDO Seclorum' (Latin for New World Order). $ has changed to $. Why? •* The Federal Reserve System is (U2l part of the US Government. (Hint: In the phone book of Bank cities, it's in the white, not blue pages.) It is a privately held corporation owned and controlled by 8 families/companies and has never been audited! They create "money" out of thin air, AKA fractional reserve banking. Economic fluctuations are intricately manipulated as the means to serve the ends of The Sinister Ones. •‘The Income Tax Amendment was never properly ratified by Congress. You are QSil required to pay federal income tax! We have been brilliantly tricked into "voluntary compliance" with the Internal Revenue Code by the use of SSNs, zip codes, checking accounts, etc. It has been proven many times that it is possible to volunteer out of The System. We are one of the highest-taxed and have the largest debt of any major country! •‘There is a distinct legal difference between the US and the USA. Common usage and legal definitions of words are not necessarily the same (e.g. citizen, must, income). Herein lies many loopholes. •“ Privileges have been substituted for rights with an endless labyrinth of money/power-generating rules and regulations. •* Your soulful Founding Fathers (remember us?) knew that the potential tyranny of big government (Big Brother) could be so infiltrating, they insightfully made The Right To Bear Arms #2 in the Bill of Rights. The real purpose of the Omnibus Crime Bill is to remove weapons from Patriots, not criminals. Let that sink in. Switzerland, having the lowest crime rate in the world, requires every adult male to own a gun. Hmmmm. •‘Traditional family values have been choreographed to be pass6. •■ Some herbs and natural remedies for diseases are now illegal...because they work! The FDA and AMA are ominous. Caring for our health is a blatant facade. The Rockefellers (Wreckafellows) rule the top 9 pharmaceutical companies. They are after total control of 14% (health care) of the GNP. •* There are at least 70,000 blue-helm eted UN "peacekeeping" (war-making) troops fiercely training within our borders, along with other very strange maneuvers and equipment in military installations. Numerous sightings of black, unmarked, low-flying UN helicopters have been recorded. They are The Unfriendlies. • There are many illegal experimental house-to-house searches and seizures reminiscent of Gestapo tactics carried out by the Multi-Jurisdictional Task Force (remember these guys). Don't wait on smiling Tom Brokaw and cohorts to inform you. •* How much is actually spent on "foreign aid" and why? What happened to America First? Our standard of living, which peaked in 1972, is now 13th in the world and falling. Why aren't we the people progressing in the land of the free(?) and the home of the brave(?)? •* What is the range of British and Israeli influence in the upper tiers??? •* The Clintonistas - Wreckafellow proteges, Marxists, Rhodes' vision, massive drug smuggling in Mena, Ark. airport, trail of dead bodies, rampant immorality and greed. • School prayer?

SPECIAL EDITION.
U.S. Government Using Scientific Weapons on American People!
According to reliable sources inside the scientific community, American civilians are guinea pigs for scientific weapons
The main articles in this issue will address an area of concern regarding victimization of Americans by the U.S. Government and its clandestine scientific weapons research organizations. This is part two of a three part series. The topic of this issue will discuss biological warfare (BW) projects and weapons developed by the government for use against what it considers its enemies-both foreign and domestic!
Historical Background of U.S. in volvement in Bacteriological Weapons Experiments...
Prior to World War II, both the Nazis and Japanese were extremely interested in cheap weapons of mass destruction that could be produced in large quantities with minimum effort. Of particular interest to this particular report is the story of Japanese Unit 731 under the command of General Shiro Ishii.
In the late 1930s, the Japanese General Staff proposed forming a unit to experiment with various viruses and bacterium for conversion into weapons. They were faced with mass numbers of Chinese troops in both China and Manchuria, and reasoned that a fatal or debilitating weapon that could be spread within the ranks of the enemy might enhance their chances of victory. From these secret meetings, Colonel Shiro Ishii, a microbiologist ffom the University of Tokyo currently serving in a water purification unit in Manchuria, was chosen to head up the experimental station.
The unit, numbered 731, eventually expanded to three locations in Manchuria:	Harbin	(the
headquarters), Pingfan, and Mukden. The locations were within convoy distance of each other, but were remote enough to keep separate experiments from becoming contaminated due to accidental crossvectoring.
At first, Ishii's staff used Chinese prisoners for guinea pigs. Over 5,000 former Nationalist Army POWs were utilized, with most dying in the process. Eventually, local criminals and even kidnapped civilians (men, women and children) were killed by BW experimentation.
Of the diseases isolated as being most effective for BW use. Plague, anthrax, dysentery, typhoid, paratyphoid, cholera, hemorrhagic fever, and gas gangrene appeared to rank high on the list. The main problem faced by Ishii and his staff concerned "vectoring," or spreading the disease between victims. "Germs"--viruses and bacterium—are spread in four means: airborne, water, food, or blood/serum. It takes one of these ways for the germs to enter the human body. For military use. a means has to be found to "infect" the target population to the extent that the BW weapon becomes effective to the largest number of people in the shortest amount of time.
Unit 731 experimented with all means of vectoring, from direct injection, to contaminated breathing air in a confined cell, to spraying cities with infected agents, rice, and fleas. It is still unknown how many innocent Chinese Unit 731 killed in its civilian experiments.
What is known, however, is how many Americans were killed.
After Ishii determined that certain diseases worked well on oriental subjects, the question arose concerning whether the same weapons would work on Caucasians. To answer this question, over 2,000 American POWs were transferred from the death camps in the Philippines to Korea, then to Mukden. Of the number that originally boarded the hell-ship Totori Mam in the Philippines, less than 1,400 arrived in Korea. Most had died enroute due to the conditions on the ship.
Those that arrived in Mukden fared little better.

Called Muratas for "logs of wood," the POWs found themselves used as guinea pigs for virtually every fatal disease experiment known to man. Many were tied to stakes in an open field, each at varying distances from a central point wherein a porcelain bomb was positioned. The bomb, containing various diseases or gangrene, was then detonated to test the blast radius and effectiveness of the device. Most prisoners used in these bomb experiments died within days, if not immediately.
Other prisoners, infected through various means, were taken to an autopsy room and strapped to tables for study. These poor souls were forced to undergo live vivisections without anesthesia while their vital organs were removed and placed in jars for future reference.
In all. almost 2.000 Allied POWs died in Ishii's experiments.
Balloon Bombs and Secret Attacks...
When the impact of a possible large scale Japanese BW attack was realized by the staff at Detrick, several questions arose regarding the effects on the population if such an attack succeeded.
To test the vectors of a deliberate BW attack the microbiologists at Fort Detrick planned and conducted at least two known experiments on the U.S. population. In die first, a huge tank filled with influenza-infected liquid was fitted to the fantail of a destroyer escort in San Diego. Early one morning, just before dawn, the ship steamed up the coast of Southern California spraying a misty cloud of disease into the air to be caught by the on-shore breeze. The target communities were the coastal towns between San Diego and Long Beach.
For three weeks the Army monitored the spread of the influenza epidemic to test the vectors, ft was determined that if the disease was of a fatal nature, it could take out Southern California in less than thirty days unless first headed off by a vaccine—provided one was available in advance in mass quantities.
When 731 finally selected which BW agents might prove most effective (Anthrax and Pneumonic Plague), the Japanese began incorporating breakable vials of die mixtures in their infamous Fu balloon bombs. By launching these rubberized rice paper balloons into the Jet Stream in Japan, the Japanese calculated that the balloons would cross the Pacific, descend in the United States, and deploy the agents among the American population.
Many of the early balloons contained incendiary devices and actually managed to start a few minor fires in the Pacific Northwest. In one incident, a family of picnickers discovered a deflated balloon in a tree, and thinking it was a weather balloon, attempted to retrieve it. The devices exploded and killed three people.
What is not generally known due to government covenips is that several bacteria infected balloon bombs also made it to the U.S. One landed in Montana, and another in New Mexico.
Enter Fort Detrick...
The device that was found in New Mexico was turned over to the Army Air Force, which promptly notified Military Intelligence. MI officers, already having some intelligence on Japanese BW experiments, then notified the Army Biological Warfare Center at Fort Detrick. Maryland. Detrick then dispatched Col. Murray Sanders, a BW expert in his own right, to inspect the find.
Another experiment had to do with a fear of Nazi saboteurs entering the country and contaminating the food or water supply. To test this theory, two agents were sent to New York City with a suitcase containing a pressurized tank of red dye. They checked into a hotel room in downtown Manhattan and proceeded to hook up the tank to the room’s water faucet. By opening the valve, they managed to back pressure the line and force the dye into the water system. Three days later pink water was still flowing throughout New York City’s central areas.
The war ended before any widespread Axis biological attacks could take place. But because of die interest generated at Fort Detrick. Murray Sanders was dispatched to Japan to attempt to find General Shiro Ishii—and his secrets.
Sanders did find Ishii. by then hiding as a civilian in a small village along the coast of Japan. But instead of bringing him in for war crimes, Sanders (and the brass at Detrick) offered Ishii and his staff a written immunity against prosecution if he would share Unit 731s findings with the U.S. Army staff at Detrick. In the days when General MacArthur’s war crimes tribunals in Tokyo were hanging every Japanese general and admiral they could find, Ishii and his officers received no less than a Presidential Pardon (in secret) from Harry Truman!
Unit 731’s data became Fort Detrick’s, and the human guinea pig experiments on Chinese and Americans (and, to a lesser number, British and Australians as well) became the operational

background for all BW experiments conducted during the Cold War and beyond to today.
The CIA and MK/NAOMI
It was during the early 1950s that Fort Detrick and the CIA became partners in BW experiments. The Technical Services Section (TSS) of the CIA, under Dr. Sidney Gottlieb, began extensive secret experiments involving two areas of interest to the clandestine	services:	Mind Control and
Bacteriological and Chemical Weaponry.
The mind control experiments involved drugs, hypnosis, "brain washing," sensory deprivation and other means of gaining control of a person's faculties. This program, under codename MK/ULTRA, is now well documented. And it was this program that injected the use of hallucinogenic drugs such as LSD into the American population. More on MK/ULTRA in the next issue of this newsletter.
MK/NAOMI, however, was more concerned with bacteriological agents. In 1952 the CIA made an agreement with the Special Operations Division (SOD) of the Army’s biological research center at Detrick whereby SOD would produce germ weapons for die CIA under a program called MK/NAOMI. (NOTE: MK is the two-letter designator for the TSS division).
MK/NAOMI, Designer Diseases, and AIDS...
In 1969. the Army and CIA was well on its way to discovering the most potent bacteriological warfare weapon of all time. It was one which solved the vector problem by confining the disease to only the population that was targeted, with a minimal chance of collateral damage to "friendlies."
In the Department of Defense Appropriations hearings before the Subcommittee on Appropriations, House of Representatives (91st Congress) in 1970, a very interesting conversation took place regarding funding through HB 15090. The persons being questioned by the congressmen were the Director, Advanced Research Project Agency; and Director, Defense Research and Engineering. The Committee Chairman was George H. Mahon of Texas. The subject was "Chemical and Biological Warfare-Synthetic Agents."
A Dr. Mac Arthur opened the discussion with: "There are two things about the biological agent field I would like to mention. One is the possibility of
technological surprise. Molecular biology is a field that is advancing very rapidly, and eminent biologists believe that within a period of 5 to 10 years it would be possible to produce a synthetic biological agent, an agent that does not naturally exist and for which no natural immunity could have been acquired."
Robert L.F. Sikes (FL) asked: "Are we doing any work in that field?
MacArthur: "We are not."
Sikes: "Why not? Lack of money or lack of interest?"
MacArthur: "Certainly not lack of interest.
Sikes then asked MacArthur to provide to the Committee details of what was required to further the BW research along the lines specified. The report, viewed with the knowledge we now possess, is terrifying. MacArthur stated:
"Within the next 5 to 10 years, it would probably be possible to make a new infective microorganism which could differ in certain important aspects from any known disease-causing organisms. Most important of these is that it might be refractory to the immunological and therapeutic processes upon which we depend to maintain our relative freedom from infectious disease." He went on to state: "A research program to explore the feasibility of this could be completed in approximately 5 years at a total cost of $10 million."
MacArthur closed this part of the report in a final paragraph that stated: "It is a highly controversial issue, and there are many who believe such research should not be undertaken lest it lead to yet another method of massive killing of large populations... Should the enemy develop it, there is little doubt that this is an important area of potential military technological inferiority in which there is no adequate research program."
Blood Vectors and the Ultimate BW Weapon...
By the mid-’70s, the scientists at Fort Detrick had succeeded in creating a "designer disease" that fit two requirements: it was blood vectored (which they thought would be contained it to the target population); and, like Dr. MacArthur predicted, it attacked the immune system of the body. This last factor allowed any local disease to take effect and disable or kill the victim.
But the Army was not satisfied with the product. To be a militarily effective weapon, it had to work

within 72 hours. Anything beyond this was considered tactically insufficient. When in battle, the time frame of the operation is critical. An extensive incubation period would not be acceptable.
But the CIA. under MK/NAOMI, was interested. The new BW weapon, which was probably designated by a project or batch number, might not suffice for the military during war, but it could surely be effective for international political blackmail--or worse, population control. Especially if it could be introduced into a population in secret, then not be traced to its origination.
Confirmation from Fort Detrick itself surfaced in the early 1990s. A former employee who worked at Detrick in the mid-’70s remembered reading "a large three-ring binder describing a new BW batch that attacked die immune system, which let other diseases run rampant in the body. It had to do with T* cells, blood serums, and stuff, and could be introduced into die target population initially in serum form. It could dien be vectored by any fluid transfer, from semen to saliva! The problem die Army had was dial it took up to five or more years before it became effective."
The story goes that the original introduction, done as an experiment in contained vectoring, occurred in two places: Zaire, Africa, and Marseille, France. In die African experiment, the World Health Organization inoculated several tribe members with Hepatitis B vaccine that had been doctored with the cancer-like virus that attacked the immune system. In France, several homosexuals were inoculated with the same supposed vaccine.
One of the French victims was an Air Canada airline steward who later became "Victim Zero." He in turn infected over 400 homosexuals on both sides of the Atlantic over the next eighteen months.
The African tribe that was inoculated was being taught by several UN teachers provided by Haiti. When these teachers returned home for visits, they carried the disease with them. Since these two initial incidents the plague, known as HIV or AIDS, has skyrocketed world-wide.
It is now known that the original AIDS virus, which was produced by splicing bovine and sheep viruses, has mutated over ten times, and if there was a protective serum against it in the beginning, it is probably no longer effective.
The Coverup and Damage Control...
At first, the U.S. Government announced that the AIDS epidemic was confined to the homosexual
community, and that it was onl/transmmed through sexual contact. Anyone who disagreed with this wfl quickly "debunked" as being a radical or without proper credentials. When the virus spread beyond the homosexual area, it was blamed on intravenous drug users sharing infected needles, and AC/DC lovers transmitting the disease on to heterosexual partners.
In actual fact, several very qualified doctors and microbiologists have determined that the A IDS virus is much more dangerous that what the government admits. For example, it is found that:
1.	All bodily fluids of an AIDS carrier are contaminated with the virus, meaning blood, sweat, tears, saliva, semen, urine, feces, vomit, mucous, puss, and even ear wax!
2.	The AIDS virus can live outside the body for up to 15 days at room temperature, and can be absorbed through the skin!
3.	The virus mutates to adapt to various environments.
4.	Blood sucking insects can carry the AIDS virus, such as mosquitos, leaches, and fleas! Researchers have stated that the Asian Tiger Mosquito (Aedes Albopictus) poses the worst mosquito-borne disease threat to the North American continent of all time.
This particular mosquito also transmits its diseases to its larvae, making them as deadly upon hatching as the adult.
In all, evidence leads us to believe that AIDS, which mathematically will depopulate the African continent by the year 2012, is a government BW project run amok.
Or was it?
A1 Gore, at the World Population Conference in Cairo, Egypt, in the fall of 1994, stated that the world population would have to be reduced by at least one-third by the year 2,000, or we would be doomed to global starvation. He did not, however, allude to how one "reduces" a huge population of billions within a five year period. He only seemed confident that it could be done.
Target: Amerika...
Besides an epidemic that is running rampant within the homosexual and drag-user sectors of society, the AIDS virus is surfacing on an ever increasing basis

^ among the heterosexual drug-free segment of our population.
It is not known exactly how this has happened, but if the scientists who claim that it can be transmitted by insect, saliva, skin oil and so on are correct, then it cannot be argued that the entire population of not only this country, but the world, is in jeopardy. Or maybe it's just l/3rd of the population...?
Besides AIDS, many other strange occurrences of diseases widiin this country have surfaced within the past 36 months. Lately, the country has undergone massive infestation of a considerably stubborn respiratory disease that seems to linger for weeks. No such disease existed before 1995. and appears to have "come out of nowhere."
This coincides with reported sightings of low-flying blacked-out helicopters that have overflown residential and rural areas at night at "roof top level, spraying some kind of chemical." Shortly after these mysterious overflights, people in the area have become infected with various respiratory diseases and certain types of influenza. The helicopters, described as black in color, appear to be US-made .UH-1 Hueys, and possibly Russian-built Kamov "Helix" helicopters whose civilian mission in Russia is
spraying crops.
Areas effected so far. according to recent reports,
are:
| Mississippi, north of Gulfport;
*	Texas, between Houston and Corpus Christi;
*	Arizona, both in Tucson and Phoenix;
*	Oklahoma, Northeastern and Southeastern
counties;
*	Pennsylvania; three towns in the eastern part of
the state;
I The Thumb of Michigan;
*	Utah, rural areas around Salt Lake City;
+ Various rural communities in Montana and
Wyoming.
There are probably other areas being infected during these mysterious nighttime flights, however these are all that have been repotted to our staff.
deployment of chemical or biological weapons during a more concerted effort-such as declaration of a National Emergency by the White House, followed by invasion of United Nations "peace making" forces brought in to "help us."
The next step, of course, would be to disarm us--by force if necessary. The force used, however, would be lessened if the population was incapacitated by sickness or aerial deployed hallucinogens.
Perhaps we now understand why so many Russian chemical and BW decontamination trucks have arrived in Saucier, Mississippi.
Is the possibility of using BW against the American people for the purposes of gun seizures, or any other reason, far fetched? No. Has the government used BW and chemical weapons on U.S. civilians before? On several occasions. Would they hesitate to do it again? Hardly.

This issue of the American Reporter has been dedicated to just one phase of criminal government activities against the American people by use of scientific devices. The next issue will address protective measures you can take to protect yourself against BW and chemical attack, and the realm of chemical weapons that have been developed and deployed against the citizens of America.
