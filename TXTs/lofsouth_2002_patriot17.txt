Strategies for the Future
As we begin to wind down A.D. 2002, the League is focused primarily on completing The Grey Book project. The Grey Book, of course, will lay out our blueprint for Southern independence, as well as our vision for a new Southern republic and our stance on certain compelling issues, cultural, social, economic, and political. This project is a massive undertaking, and I would like to thank everyone who has thus far contributed to it. At present, we hope to go to press with the final draft by mid-November; however, if necessary, we will give ourselves ample time to do the job right. A central feature of The Grey Book will be a draft of a Constitution for our new country.
C-SPAN finally (on 23 and 24 August) aired coverage from our 9th annual conference in Abbeville, South Carolina on 20 July. But of all the speeches recorded, they chose to run only mine. Regarding the others, by Ray McBerry, Dr. Thomas DiLorenzo. Dr. Jim Kibler, Ron Holland, Robert Hayes, and Jack Kershaw, C-SPAN remains mute. I presume the network is afraid to run these excellent presentations because it will garner for us too much good publicity. Conversely, C-SPAN seems to have no trouble finding time to air speeches by slavery reparations advocates and the NAACP and the Rainbow Coalition. All in all, though, we had a good response from the coverage we did receive. We sent out hundreds of packets of information and got scores of new members. Not a bad day's work.
Several League members were invited by Director Ron Maxwell to view pre-release screenings of the movie ’Gods and Generals' (due out in late January 2003). The consensus is that the film, centered on the life of the great Stonewall, is dedicated to telling the truth about The War and is. for the most part, devoid of anti-South political correctness. Make plans to spread the word and to see the movie early next year.
Thanks to the generosity of League donors to our new Employment Fund (see July-August issue of this newsletter), I am able to announce the hiring of South Carolina State Chairman Jay Mowery as our Chief Operations Officer (COO), [continued]

Mr Mowery will oversee various League operations based on policy set by the League Board of Directors. Please welcome him to this new post and give him your full cooperation as he carries out the duties of this new office.
As of the end of September, we have raised about $4000, with another $13-$14,000 pledged to the Employment Fund. Our goal for the first year (1 September 2002 until 31 August 2003) is to raise $ 100,000 for this fund so we can hire additional paid staff. If you’d like to make a monthly pledge ($20, $40, $60, ???), call or write the League home office for a pledge coupon booklet. We also encourage one-time donations for those who cannot afford to make a monthly pledge. Checks or money orders should be made payable to The League of the South,' designated for 'Employment Fund,' and mailed to the home office.
Most likely, we will have our 10th annual national conference again in Abbeville in July 2003. The 2002 conference was a smashing success, and we want to continue a good thing. More details later in the newsletter.
I want to thank all our members for their hard work and generosity for the League and for our cause. Almighty God has truly blessed us. May we always be faithful to Him, to each other, and to the cause of a free and independent Dixie.
Deo Vindice,
Michael Hill President
Book review by Michael Hill
League and LSI faculty member. Dr Thomas Fleming (Editor, Chronicles Magazine and President, Rockford Institute), has written a thought-provoking new book entitled Montenegro: The Divided Land (Chronicles Press, 2002).
Dr Fleming wrote this work because the ‘story of Montenegro’s 500-year struggle for independence is interesting in itself, and, when it is put in the context of the current efforts by the international community to detach Montenegro from Serbia, the history of tiny Crna Gora becomes a paradigm for an emerging global system that seems determined to eliminate historic cultures [and] religions.’
The book, which ought to be of interest to patriotic Southerners who wish to preserve their own historic culture, has been praised for its accuracy by leading historians in Yugoslavia, most notably Slavenko Terzic, Director of the Historical Institute of the Serbian Academy of Arts and Sciences. To order your copy, call Chronicles Magazine at (815) 964-5054 or write to Chronicles, 928 North Main Street, Rockford, IL 61103.

WHO SAID IT....
A.	George Bush or
B.	Julius Caesar
'Beware the leader who bangs the drums of war in order to whip the citizenry into a patriotic fervor, for patriotism is indeed a two-edged sword. It both emboldens the blood, just as it narrows the mind.
'And when the drums of war have reached a fever pitch and the blood boils with hate and the mind is dosed, the leader will have no need in seizing the rights of the citizenry. Rather, the citizenry, infused with fear and blinded by patriotism, will offer up all their rights unto their leader and gladly so.'	(Caesar	it was!)

The Living and the Dead
by Franklin Sanders
In 1832 the radical - I would call him ‘Revolutionary’ - philosopher Jeremy Bentham died in London. Following the instructions he had left in his will, his body was dissected in the presence of his friends. Then his skeleton was fitted out with a wax head to replace the original, which had been mummified. The body, dressed in Bentham’s own clothes, was set up on a chair in a glass-fronted case. There you can still see them today in University College, London. (That dissecting scene reminds me of what Westbrook Pegler said about Eleanor Roosevelt’s funeral, ‘Thousands came - some to mourn, most to make sure.’)
This reminds me of a ‘20/20’ show I saw last week. Please don’t tell anyone that 1 watch TV, but I walked through the room, and it was on and 1 was tired, so I sat down and watched it. You know what the latest craze is? Freeze drying your dead pet. Why anyone would want a dead cat sitting on his lap is beyond me, but there is a taxidermist in Pennsylvania who will freeze dry your pet.
Both of these bizarre cases remind me of those people who talk about the constitution as a ‘living document.’ They really don’t want anything ‘living,’ certainly not the original. What they really want is the dead, empty shell to manipulate while pretending it is alive.
How do we honour the constitution aright? First we must understand two things:
+The constitution is a Christian document, and
+The constitution is not a self-enforcing document.
CHRISTIAN BY CONFESSION
AND STRUCTURE Knowing that all sorts of people in the last few decades have argued against and for the Christian foundation of this country and the Christianity of the founders, I still have to observe that the United States constitution is Christian document on its face, both by Confession and by Structure.
BY CONFESSION The confession is found in Article VII, at the very end of the constitution where the framers wrote ‘done in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred Eighty seven.’ The skeptic will look at me and say, ‘Oh, don’t be silly. That was a mere convention of the day.’
No, it was not a mere convention. Ask yourself, ‘Does it appear on public documents today?’ Why not? The Founders were men of precise speech, men of their word, and they never gave that word lightly. They meant exactly what they said, and knew exactly what they signed.
Consider the removal of ‘in the year of our Lord’ or A.D. everywhere today. If it is a mere convention, why are they so anxious to remove it? They have gone so far as to change ‘B.C.’, before Christ, to ‘BCE’, where the ‘C’ means not ‘Christian’ but ‘Common’ -‘Before the Common Era.’
Why do these people seek to change a mere convention? Because they seek to deny the watershed event of history, after which everything changed. So all of us, like the founders, ought to put ‘A.D.’ on everything, precisely because it is not a convention.
Why is that? Because externals matter. Matter matters. We are snared by the words of our mouth. They outwardly confess and affirm an inward reality.
4
So ‘in the year of our Lord’ does not express a mere form or convention, but declares a reality that will bless or curse us. In the constitution it is an explicit declaration of the Christian nature and hope of the document.
CHRISTIAN BY STRUCTURE The constitution is also a Christian document by structure. It is a Trinitarian document, where that Trinitarianism reflects the basic nature of God in all creation and all relations.
That Trinitarianism shows in the constitution’s tripartite government, the separation of powers among three branches of government and among the federal and state governments.
Federalism is a Christian Trinitarian concept, and could never arise from monistic and pagan cultures. Because the nature of the god of those cultures is one, and centralises all power in himself, they always end in centralising power in civil government. But the motto on the United State coat of arms, e pluribus unum, out of many one, points to what? The Trinity, and then to the Trinitarian model of the Church, with many members, but one body.
The constitution's federalism also points to ancient Israel and its history accounted in the Bible. Now this is not obvious to our Biblically illiterate society, raised and fed on the Nightly News and the Ozzy Osborne Show, but Biblical history was standard fare for the Founders. They had been raised on it. They knew the federal nature of the ancient Hebrew republic inside and out, with its division of powers among the tribes and division of power among officers. Only certain people were allowed to hold certain offices. The king, for example, was forbidden to hold the office of priest. From the Bible the Founders had also learned the

corrupting influence of centralising power, that a national government that abolishes federal diversity for centralism descends quickly into tyranny and corruption, empire and slavery.
The constitution’s separation of powers also betrays a Christian worldview. It applies the doctrine of the sinfulness of man by hemming every power in with checks and balances. The writing of the constitition itself expresses the Christian hope that men, by the grace of God, can create institutions that will overcome that depravity and accomplish the work of Christ on earth. How? By creating peace for the proclamation and realisation of the Gospel, bringing closer the day when knowledge of the glory of God will cover the earth as the waters cover the sea.
Finally, the Christianity of the constitution is also there in the details. They are too many to number, but nearly every right in the bill of rights - freedom of the church, freedom of speech, the right to bear arms, the right to confront witnesses, the right not to testify against yourself, the inviolability of property - nearly all of these appear first in the Scriptures. So for any with eyes to see, the constitution is a Christian document by structure and confession.
THE CONSTITUTION IS NOT SELF-ENFORCING The second face of the constitution that we must understand is someone must enforce the constitution. The great Calhoun scholar, Clyde Wilson, is fond of saying, ‘The constitution is not a self-enforcing document.’ If the constitution is to be kept alive, somebody must do it. Someone must enforce its institutions and claims. ‘Oh,’ you ask, ‘but isn’t that what government officials are for?’
No. The constitution's answer to that question is no. They are only part of the constitutional equation, and much the lesser part. The greater part, the real enforcers, are the states and you, the people, the heirs of the document, those for whom its favours are established. Read the constitution's preamble: ‘We the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and to our posterity, do ordain and establish this constitution for the United State of America.’
But how do we enforce it? The states’ duty is to interpose themselves between their citizens and a federal government
bent on tyranny. Obviously, the states have long ago been rendered dumb and toothless dogs against national government.
What can you do? You must make a claim. You cannot remain silent, because silentio facet, silence consents. When the federal government oversteps your rights, you must become a ‘belligerent claimant in person.’
You must enforce the constitution. You must protect it when it is wounded. You must resist!
Resist!
If the constitution is to be preserved, you must do it. No one else can. You are the heirs. Only you can make the claim.

Now when I say ‘resist,’ I do not mean go grab your gun and start blasting. No, that is the last, the very last and most desperate means of resistance. Before that come all other lawful means of resistance, whether in court, or informing your neighbours, and working for a political party or movement.
I do not take anything away from the thousands of brave men who have gone to defend their country in time of war, but I must say that in a sense it is easy to fight when everyone else is. It is quite another matter to fight when you are alone, and no one supports you..
I think about a friend of mine, a quiet, gentle Christian man opposing the state of Tennessee. The federal government has mandated that the state include a social security number on every drivers licence, and my friend has been fighting this unconstitutional requirement.
Alone. This is not a glorious fight. In fact, some would call it contemptible. But we must help others resist, because they are fighting our battle for our inheritance.
The Declaration of Independence, you may remember, complains that the king has been guilty of a long ‘train of usurpations.’ One of those is, ‘For depriving us, in many Cases, of the Benefits of Trial by Jury: For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended Offenses.’
Do you know what they were referring to? In colonial times, when the British arrested a colonial for smuggling, they couldn’t get a conviction in front of an American jury, because the Americans opposed the tax, and refused to convict. The Americans helped each other against the tyrant. So not very surprisingly, the British just removed the accused to England, where they could try them without a jury, and in
their own courts, and be assured of a conviction.
In exactly the same way as those colonial Americans, we must show ourselves ready to defend our common inheritance. And don’t fool yourselves, when these judges, even federal judges, look up and see a courtroom full of witnesses, their behaviour changes.
Wait a minute! Are you promoting rebellion? What about Romans 13, etc.? Aren’t we supposed to obey ordained authority?
Those who say that we must never oppose government because it is ordained by God are wrong. Read the Scriptures. Rulers are ordained as a terror to evil, not good. How can my enforcing the law and my inheritance given me by God be evil?
NO! Resist! Not to resist those who would kill the constitution - or worse, subvert it, claiming it is alive while they gut the life out of it but leave the embalmed corpse leering at us like Jeremy Bentham - to not resist them is to yield to evil. Obedience to tyrants is rebellion against God, when they command evil. The converse is also true: obedience to tyrants is resistance to God.
You will answer to God for the inheritance you leave to your children.! have never said this before publicly, because privately I know the cost. I say it now because I know the cost, too -the cost of inaction. It is to lose the constitution with all its blessings. It is to condemn your children to slavery.
Christ told us that if you want to save your life, you must lose it. That principle is everywhere true. I tell you today, if you want to save your liberty, you must be willing to lose it. If you will not fight because you fear you will
lose your property, you love your property too much, and at last you will lose both your freedom and your property. Whoever will not risk his freedom and his property and his life to maintain his liberty-and the liberty of his children-can never be free but will always remain the slave of dead things - worse than the slave of live men.
Recently a friend and I bought some bees. If you got close enough, you could see how lumpy my hands are from the stings I got processing honey last Saturday. God gives pictures through humble things, and we ought to heed those pictures. When you come close to a beehive, the bee will fly at your head and bump you. She’s warning you to stay away. If you come closer, she will sting you, but she knows that when she stings, she dies. That is the cost she must pay, and she will die to defend her privacy and her property. We ought to learn from the bee.
RESIST! I do not recommend you go out and pick a fight, but if the providence of God brings one to your door, then fight! You must put everything else aside, and say, ‘This is my day to defend the constitution. This is my day to go to jail. This is my day to fight.’ You stand in a long chain that stretches from your grandchildren and children through you and back to Jackson and Lee and Washington and Runnymede and, at last, to Calvary.
In the end, no constitution on earth can guarantee the continuance of your freedom. For your freedom there is no other safeguard, no other security, than your willingness to stand, to fight, and to die.

Interview with Jack Kershaw
Mr Jack Kershaw, attorney and artist of Nashville is a Director ofthe League ofthe South, and president ofthe Mary Noel Kershaw Foundation. The Presidential Fund of the MNK Foundation (see page 8) has been set up to keep Dr Hill as full-time League president.
Interview by Ross Massey,
June 2002
RM: When were, you born?
JK: October 12th, 1913.
RM: So you will be 89 this year. I remember you were born in Joplin, Missouri. You have lived in Nashville, so how did that happen?
JK: My father had an interest in zinc mines in Missouri.
RM: Your wife passed away in 1989, but she has not been forgotten.
JK: I set up the Mary Noel Kershaw Foundation to promote good, traditional Southern culture. I am sure she would have approved.
RM: I recall you majored in geology at Vanderbilt. Did your father get you interested in geology?
JK: He got me interested in history. I found I like the shape of rocks more than the mineralogical content. I took more English than geology.
RM: I recall you had some famous teachers.
JK: Donald Davidson was certainly one. He was responsible for the agrarian movement. I did not have a class under him. I had sophomore English under Robert Penn Warren. I had creative writing under John C. Ransom.
RM: Did you stay in contact with any of the Agrarians?
JK: Davidson and I worked closely together in school integration cases, as his wife was a lawyer. Mel Bradford
was a student, and we became friends. He was a most important contemporary force in promoting the Southern point of view.
RM: When did you study law?
JK: Not until the 1960s. I went to the Nashville School of Law.
RM: What was your most interesting case?
JK: Defending parents resisting compulsory school integration. But a more famous case was defending James Earl Ray when congress was investigating him. He was falsely accused. I showed that the rifle they had, that was supposed to be Ray's, and the bullet they said was from King’s body, did not match. Five ballistic experts would not say the bullet had been fired from their rifle.
RM: Has anything improved in the South during your lifetime?
JK: No. It has degenerated. The Yankee invasion (migration to the South) has contaminated the fabric of our society, as some good Yankees will acknowledge. We hope they will learn good manners.
RM: Do you find any young Southerners have good manners?
JK: Yes. It is surprising.
RM: And some Yankees?
JK: Some, of course. Most are aggressive and rude, and lack what some good Southern ladies call ‘refinement.’
RM: What is the best art gallery you have visited?
JK: The Met in New York, but most galleries are to be avoided.
RM: Of all the art you have created, which is your favourite?
JK: What I am working on now. The Scream 9-11’. It was a cry for help that was never answered. The irony of the World Trade Center is that it was not the greatest disaster on American soil. Greater disasters were the burning of
7
cities like Atlanta and Columbia by the United States Army, during our war for independence.
RM: You were involved in founding the League of the South. Does it have a strategy to attract members?
JK: There is a vast national concern for the leviathan monster that we have for a central government. Mishandling of immigration for instance. Many parents are concerned about the public school system, which suffers from Washington’s dictatorial control. Southern states need to control their borders, and this message should attract members. However, mere attraction of members is not the goal. The goal is to preserve the many facets of Southern culture, if that goal is realized members will appear as a matter of course.
RM: Is the Sons of Confederate Veterans on the right track?
JK: There are signs that it is, but there seems to be an old established clique that is more concerned with antiquarian nick-nacks (medals, etc.), than with serious cultural aspects of the South. The SCV could be a powerful force on the political scene, but it’s not.
RM: You and I have a problem with the word ‘indivisible’ in the pledge to the US flag. Please comment on that.
JK: 1 find the ceremony of saying it at a SCV meeting to be incongruous. Our forefathers fought to preserve the Constitution. The 10th Amendment contains the right to secede, so our pledge should be that we pledge to uphold the Constitution.
RM: Much of what made the South good is agrarian roots. Our population growth is out of control with Yankees and other foreign cultures moving in. What one thing can Southerners do to maintain our society?
JK: Arm yourselves.
