1. A presidential crime commiseion recently reported that there are now 3 MILLION I CRIMES EACH MONTH, conmitted against American High School stud ante, 2 $0,000 of which are crinea of violence*
2* It ie painfully obvious to all White students attending integrated public schools, that the vast overwhelming majority of both crinea in general, and violent crinea are comitted by Blacks, in the state of North Carolina*
3* White-on-Black crinea of violence in our schools are virtually non-existent, while Black-on-White crimes of violence Is ranpant and indeed, out of control*
it* Simply crime statistics proves that North Carolina's lsw enforcement agencies can not, and are not controlling violent crinea against White school children*
5* This rampaging racist violence directed against White achool children will no longer be tolerated by the White citlaens of North Carolina*
6* We will act to protect our own children*
7* It Is therefore, suggested by the nanbere and supporters of the Carolina Anights of the Ku Klux Klan, that the Attorney Qeneral take the following actions
1)	Appoint an investigative consoles ion to study the problem of racial violence and intlaidation in our public schools*
2)	Release tho results of this Investigation to the public*
3)	Establish a "Citlien's Militia11 to augment established law enforcement agencies* This "Citisen's Militia" will petrol school grounds and achool buses to maintain law ana order, and to protect White school children from violent racist assaults and intimidations •
It) Provide a written res pones to this letter indicating the proposed action by the Attorney General, NOT LAXBl THAN 30 days from today*
6* Should satisfactory actions not be taken to protect • i the White school children of this state Aron violent racist attacks and Intimidations, we will take the following actions ourselves«
(1) A massive White narch, rally, and demonstration will be bald in the downtown area cf Raleigh, North Caroline on March bth, 1961*•
d petrols in the arses
(2) On March 5th, 1981*, 1,000 White nsn will begin of selected public schools in North Caroline*
9* fate hope end we pray that the Attorney General will not continue to sweep this racial problem under the rug, and that he will take action to protect North Carolina's children from racist assaults end intimidations*
10* In the Sacred, Unfailing Bond of the Ku Klus Klan, I an respectfully yours,
