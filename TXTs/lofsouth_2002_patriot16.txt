The Best Yet, and More to Come
The League of the South’s 9th annual conference in Abbeville, South Carolina (18-20 July) was the biggest and best yet. We had about 425 attendees, about half of them decked out in Red Shirts. C-SPAN was there to cover all the speeches and music on Saturday, the 20th. As I write, C-SPAN has yet to air the coverage. We also audiotaped the conference, and tapes can be ordered by calling Jeff McCormack at Apologia Services, (601) 928-5218.
We appreciate Basic Gray (Larry Smith and Nat Rudulph) once again providing some fine live music. Also, we would like to thank Michigan member Evan Kuettner for playing some good Celtic music on his fiddle and New York member George Forsyth for his usual inspirational bag-pipe performance. If you missed this conference, be sure to make your plans to be at the 10th annual meeting in 2003. You won't want to miss this event. Details as to time and place will be forthcoming within a couple of months.
The 7th annual LSI Summer Institute on the Southern Literary Tradition, held in conjunction with the annual conference, was a smashing success. We had between 25 and 30 students who were treated to a series of lectures by the finest unreconstructed Southern professors. Topics included William Gilmore Simms, William Faulkner, Flannery O’Connor, Andrew Nelson Lytle, George Garrett, Fred Chappel, William Goyen, Confederate War Poetry, among others. The highlight of the entire week was a series of readings by League authors from their own works (i.e. poetry, short stories, novels). I knew we had some excellent talent in the League, but I was overwhelmed by the depth of that which was on display in Abbeville. Congratulations to LSI Director, Dr Clyde Wilson, for a successful event. We will have future reports also on the summer schools held this year in Baton Rouge, Macon, and Austin. Also, our thanks go out to Tad Brown of Thomson, Georgia, for his generous donation of funds for scholarship for the Abbeville Summer School.
The League continues to grow steadily. We had a drop in recruitment after 11 September 2001, but things have picked up nicely in 2002. We expect that the completed ‘Grey Book’ project (set for mid-November) will give

our organisation an additional boost. The ‘Grey Book’ will be a comprehensive blueprint for the League’s objective of Southern independence. At present, we are ‘farming out’ writing assignments to the members. We will soon post the outline on dixienet.org and would appreciate all members checking it out to see if there are subjects on which you might be able to help us.
For all of its eight years of existence, the League has largely been an organisation run by volunteers. Except for a paid Office Manager, we have had no paid employees (my salary, as President of the LSI, is paid by the Kershaw Foundation). If every member of the League would be willing to pledge $10, $20, or $30 a month to a fund designated for hiring paid positions in the organisation, then we could employ the following: 1) a national field director; 2) a public relations director; 3) a part-time secretary for the national office; and 4) a paid editor for this newsletter and for a League journal. A tank of gasoline costs about $20. Surely the cause of Southern independence is worth that to our members! For $ 10 you can take your wife to McDonalds—or you can help us fund one of these crucial positions for the League.
I know that we have the most generous members of any organisation when it comes to financial contributions. I see it every day. What I’m asking is for you to dig a little bit deeper and help us become the force for Southern nationalism that we ought to be. We can go only so far with volunteers; we need a
full-time, professional staff, and your generous donation can make it happen. Please see the pledge form on page 11 of this issue of the newsletter and mail in your pledge, made payable to The League of the South, today. Mark your contribution 'Employment Fund' and send it to: League of the South, PO Box 14184, Monroe, Louisiana 71207.
As some of you know already, we have tapped Mr Jay Mowery, Chairman of the South Carolina League, to hold the post of National Field Director. Several of you have made generous contributions so we can put Jay to work in helping the State and local chapters grow. Jay has made a leap of faith, and we are depending on you to keep him supplied with the wherewithal he needs to carry out this important job for the League. To put it simply, we cannot succeed in moving your organisation forward without your dedication and help. Please remember the sacrifices that previous generations of Southerners have made to the cause of liberty. They pledged ‘blood, treasure, and sacred honour’ to the cause. I pray that you will do the same.

Southern Redemption in Abbeville
MORE ON THE LS CONFERENCE by Wayne Carlson
Against the backdrop of a people over governed to monstrous excess in what was once a beautifully decentralized federal Republic of Sovereign States, hundreds of Southern Nationalists gathered in Abbeville, South Carolina recently for the 9th National Conference of the League of the South. Now engulfed by an unrestrained worldwide American Empire that has left them vulnerable to acts of terrorism from numerous foreign victims, these Southern patriots are justly anxious for the safety and survival of their people. More than this. Southerners have become increasingly aware that the unique culture and civilisation bequeathed them, is being deliberately marginalized and destroyed by their association with those who possess no love, appreciation, or sympathy for all that they love and wish to preserve.
Thus it is that as a member of the Virginia League of the South I had the pleasure of joining a large gathering of determined redeemers in Historic Abbeville. My dictionary gives the following meaning to the word redeem, ‘to get or win back, to free from captivity, to extricate from or help to overcome something detrimental, to change for the better, and to repair and restore.’ Those who gathered in the Palmetto State, and the thousands of others who were there in spirit, have no other mis-
sion than to extricate their people, subdued and conquered in war, from the vise like grip, easily confused with the vice their enemies promote, that they presently retain. Peace loving, overwhelmingly Christian, devoted to the rule of law and principles that once marked the old Republic before they were deliberately perverted, the League of the South is nothing if not an organisation looking for Southern Redemption.
Abbeville proved to be an ideal location as it has been called the birthplace of Southern Independence. On 22 November 1860, the first mass meeting calling for Southern secession took place there. Less than a month later, on 20 December, South Carolina led the rest of the South out of the compact, or union, that they had joined some 70 years before. Conference attendees had the rather unique pleasure of immersing themselves in both the past and the present Southern Independence Movements.
Signaling that perhaps this movement has appeared on the Empire’s radar screen was the presence of a film crew from C-SPAN, which apparently plans to air the conference nationally at some future date. No viewers could fail to be impressed by both the array of distinguished and eloquent speakers, and the enthusiastic energy of an obviously captivated audience prone to repeated outbursts of boisterous applause.
On the final day of the three-day conference, Tim Manning Sr. opened the day’s events by prayerfully calling upon, and acknowledging Jesus Christ as our spiritual redeemer. It is of no little importance that we should recognise that when representatives of our openly pantheistic Empire, having rejected our Christian foundations, ac-
_ 4
knowledge anything spiritual, it is by speaking about some abstract ‘God’ that presumably is knowable through any religion anywhere. This, as real Christians know, is an affront to Christ’s unequivocal claim in John 14:6, ‘I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.’ It is fitting that the League opens its gatherings by offering up an invocation to the author of all our blessings and liberties. Without our Lord and Saviour’s favour we could not, and should not expect our collective efforts to be crowned with success. It is upon our confession of reliance on the Almighty and his word, the source of revealed truth, that we can hope to liberate ourselves from an apostate regime cloaking its heresy in meaningless reference’s to everyone’s version of ‘God’.
League President, Dr Michael Hill, recently pointed out in his ‘Pax Americana’ article that the elitists in politics and business have transformed the Old Republic into a multicultural empire. They have done so without regard to the Constitution, the warnings of the founders, or the wishes of the people they claim to represent. Being unconstitutional, having destroyed the Federalist System that made the Republic possible, we are faced with an illegitimate regime claiming to speak and act on our behalf.
After some inspirational music from the duo of ‘Basic Gray,’ Dr Hill gave a scholarly overview of the Constitution’s founding that justified Southern Independence in 1861 and justifies a renewed effort toward that end today. Indeed, the threats to our rights and liberties in 1861 pale in comparison to what we face today. Mr. Robert Hayes, who presently runs the
League Building in Abbeville and Dr James E. Kibler, who serves as the League Cultural Committee Chairman, followed Dr Hill’s remarks by reminding the audience that throughout history the price of liberty has been high and that to expect success from halfhearted effort is foolish. The Southern Style BBQ dinner that followed was an opportunity to check out the venders, enjoy some fine Southern cuisine, and continue to revel in the incomparable pleasantries of fellowship with like-minded Southern patriots.
The fiery speech delivered by Mr Ray McBerry of Dixie Broadcasting (www.DixieBroadcasting.com or www.WDXB.com) entitled ‘Southern Redemption,’ kicked off the afternoon sessions with a resounding bang. The repeated bursts of applause prompted Mr McBerry to remark that the length of his speech had been doubled. The speakers that followed, Mr Ron Holland, Mr Jack Kershaw, and Dr Thomas J. DiLorenzo added to the lustre of the day’s events and served to inspire the determination among those present to work increasingly hard to forge a separate and distinct future for the Southern people. The ongoing growth of the League of the South is a testament to the courage and intellect of men and women who know that the present government, divorced from the wisdom of her founders, and far from justly claiming to be a government of, by, and for the people, is in fact of Yankee design and origin, imposed on the rest of us. It is an affront to the principles that justified the independence of 13 colonies in 1776, and then 11 States in 1860-61, namely government by consent of the governed. In short, the ongoing work of the League of the South is a reminder that we do have an alternative, whether people wish to
recognise that fact or not. This writer believes that the freedoms awaiting an independent Dixie, when compared to the eroding freedoms and resultant dangers under the present regime, are the difference between true liberty and merely one form of slavery, with the all-powerful State acting as overseer
on an expanding plantation. 1 say let us redeem our land that we might provide a place for our children to come to know their true redeemer. Deo Vindice!

The Present Unpleasantness
by Randall Ivey
Here is a joke that isn’t really a joke.
What do Yankees and stone-deaf old women have in common?
They both talk at the top of their lungs, no matter where they are or to whom they are talking.
I had an aunt who went deaf and refused to employ any modifying gadget. No hearing aid for her. She wouldn’t have a machine in her ear buzzing away like some angered hornet. No tin ear either (she was old enough to remember them); she said it would have made her look like an old phonograph player. The only machine she would use would be the considerable bellows of her own lungs, and with them she spoke at such a volume she would make the teeth in your own head vibrate (it did not help that she insisted, in personal conversations, on getting as close to her listener as possible, sometimes with chins nearly touching, as though it were you, not she, who had the hearing problem). She spoke thus no matter where she went - church, market, neighbor’s parlor - and no one said a thing to her, of course, because she was old (ninety-three when she left this world to hear, with perfect acuity, the songs of the angels).
So what excuse do the Yankees have?
‘Well,’ my wife says, ‘they were raised close together in big cities, amid a cacophony of noise. They probably always had to shout to be heard. Bless their hearts!’
My wife is a charitable sort - bless her
heart - always seeking out what good she can even in those situations hopelessly lost to barbarism. It is because of this charity that I could not make her face her own logical error, her sweeping generalization: that not all Yankees could claim a big city birthright for their volubility. There are indeed and inevitably Yankees brought up in hamlets and villages and podunks hardly larger than postage stamps who nevertheless believe their every pronouncement must be a shout or a booming declaration delivered in decibels that would send the dogs running along.
So why are Yankees so loud?
I have no answers, only examples.
It was a mild December night. My wife and 1 attended a mortuary wake for another, much younger relation in Gaffney, a town in the South Carolina upcountry. It was a forty-minute drive either way and way past dark, of course, when we arrived home. Both of us were hungry. We had had no supper prior to embarking for Gaffney and decided to stop at a small family restaurant not too far from our home. The place was nearly empty, except for a booth filled by three adults, two men and one woman, all of relative youth, although each was probably nearing forty. We were seated at a table a slight right angle to theirs and almost instantaneously I knew we were in trouble.
‘IN NEW YORK,’ one of the men said nearly at the top of his lungs, giving himself away not only by his volume but also by his reference to that place, ‘ON EVERY CORNER THERE ARE THREE AND FOUR RESTAURANTS THAT STAY OPEN ALL NIGHT LONG! BUT HERE? HERE IN THIS TOWN? THEY SHUT DOWN AT TEN
O’CLOCK! OH MY GOD!’
He wasn’t praying, of course, calling on the one force which could temper his hubris and tame his tongue. He was swearing. My wife looked at me. She knew there would be no chance now of my finding pleasure in the meal. The New Yorker with the insomniac tapeworm had sounded the trumpet ushering in my disgust.
‘We can change tables,’ my wife offered, ‘or go someplace else. I can fix us something at home.’
No. To move would be to concede defeat. We would not move or leave. Besides, I had a fascination for these debased creatures, the way other people are hypnotized by autopsies and automobile accidents. I wanted to see what ugly shapes they could twist themselves into, what fools they could make of themselves, what verbal catastrophes they would wreak each time they opened their mouths. It was one of the few certainties in the world I knew of.
These three did not disappoint me.
The woman with them let out a long, hollow, sinister laugh, the kind of laugh you might have heard come from the bride of Dracula; it had that same blood-curdling effect. ‘COME ON, LARRY!’ she followed up with little loss of enthusiasm or volume. ‘SURELY YOU ARE NOT COMPARING NEW YORK TO THIS PLACE, THIS ...THIS PROVINCIAL HOLE IN THE GROUND... THIS BOZART OF THE SAHARAS.
I MEAN MY GOD!’ And a second laugh followed, more ghoulish than the first.
I managed to steal glances at them, quick enough not to be rude but long enough to have all my dire suspicions
confirmed. The woman was fairly young, but both men had reached early middle age. The first one to have spoken was bearded and bald and, like so many men who cannot accept the laws of nature, had grown a ponytail which he secured with rubber bands into a salt and pepper braid that rested along his shoulder like some rodent he had trained to sit there. The man across from him was also bald and bearded, and he had an earring in his left ear from which suspended a small crucifix, though I could not imagine it had any religious significance for him. The woman herself was small, bony, anorexic, and clearly had not been informed that Twiggy no longer served as a paradigm for fashion-conscious women.
I had plenty of time to study them because our waitress, the only person serving at that hour, a young girl with a pierced eyebrow and small blue tattoo on her forearm, took her time in attending to my wife and me. She was clearly more interested in the bohemian trio across from us. She was constantly obsequious to them, bringing them tea refills and asking about their quality of their meal. At times she would even ignore her duties, those for which she was getting paid, and lean against the booth and listen to the three of them go on and on, berating my little hometown and touting the metropolitan colossi from which they had shuffled' back and forth like nomads.
They criticized the pace of the town, the unletteredness of its citizens, the lack of cultural opportunities, the dearth of bars and singles clubs, the number of churches on every comer. They cursed, they swore, they laughed loud and unrestrainedly in their opprobrium. It was as though they were in their own home, their den talking, and
not in a place with other people.
‘BUT, LORELI,’ one of the men addressed the vampriss, the living reed, ‘THIS IS YOUR HOMETOWN! HOW CAN YOU CRITICIZE IT SO?’
It wasn’t, of course, a sincere question. It was a joke question. He laughed as he asked it. He made the other man laugh so hard he sounded as though he were about to choke. I glanced over at them in time to see the woman roll her eyes then hold her inquisitor in a look of mock contempt before bursting out herself into another of her long, heart-stopping, empty cackles. The moon was high and full in the sky that night.
‘OH MY GOD, DAVID! MUST YOU REMIND ME? MUST YOU? THE ONLY REASON I CAME BACK TO THIS WASTELAND WAS OUT OF LOVE FOR MY DEAR DEPARTED AUNT MARY. A MAVERICK LIKE MYSELF. AN ICONOCLAST. A MARCHER TO A DIFFERENT DRUMMER. IT WAS SHE WHO ENCOURAGED ME TO GO ON STAGE AND PERFORM - ‘
‘Theatre people!’ I hissed to my wife, who laid her hand across her mouth.
‘ - IT WAS AUNT MARY WHO TOLD ME TO TAKE THE PATH LEAST TRAVELED BY OTHERS, TO SEEK TO BE DIFFERENT, TO BE PROUD OF MY DIFFERENCE. SHE WARNED ME IT WOULD BE HARD. SHE WARNED ME THERE WOULD BE DETRACTORS. BUT I HELD MY HEAD HIGH AND WALKED OUT OF THIS GOD FORSAKEN TOWN WITH THE PRIDE OF A TRUE REBEL.’
‘I can’t stand this place either,’ the waitress added, still ignoring us. ‘It’s
for the dogs.’ She was clearly trying to win the approval of her worldly elders. ‘And when I get eighteen years old. I’m clearing out of here and not ever looking back.’
‘GOOD FOR YOU!’
‘Miss,’ I called to the waitress, as much to stop their blathering as to get service. ‘Miss, we haven’t been waited on yet.’ The girl eyed me contemptuously and with obvious resentment tore herself from the happy, hippy trio.
‘What y’all want?’ she asked us through her chewing gum, as though we were strangers on her doorstep in the middle of the night and not customers. As she turned to put in the order, I lightly touched her elbow. She looked around.
‘You ought to be ashamed of yourself,’ I told her. She went away.
In the meantime Eeny, Meeny, and Miney continued their castigation of my hometown, and each insult made a new wound in me. After awhile, though, I no longer took the injuries personally. They didn’t apply only to the place where I was bom and reared. They took on greater destruction that affected more than this little upcountry South Carolina town. It was as though these three, with their merciless tongues, were smearing mud on the Pieta, playing a Mozart sonata out of tune, screaming out Hamlet’s Soliloquy, taking a pickaxe to David - in short destroying all that was good and decent and true in the world. It depressed me so I almost could not eat.
It so happens we all rose from our tables at the same time. The Threesome made it to the cash register before us, and their new friend the waitress made a great fuss over them, telling them to ‘please come back’, be-

fore realizing what she had just said. They all laughed.
The girl corrected herself. ‘Of course I know y’all don’t want to do that. So.. .please DON’T come back.’ They laughed again.
‘WE WON’T IF WE CAN HELP IT!’ bawled the Thin One, as though she were in the middle of traffic and not a semi-deserted restaurant in a quiet, peaceable place. She turned to join her balding compatriots. I stopped her with a hand on her shoulder.
She looked at me, almost smiling but not quite yet clearly anxious and curious to know what I wanted.
‘You said you were from here, didn’t you? This place? Here?’
She nodded slightly, her eyes still wide with curiosity.
I nodded back. ‘Then what happened to you?’
She cocked her head slightly, as though to see me better.
‘How did you lose your soul?’
Then she did smile - with her lips only at first. Then the smile grew to show teeth, and soon afterwards she was emitting another of those long, dead, otherworldly laughs which made the extremities of my face shake. Her eyes were just as hollow. She didn’t answer me. Like the waitress, she ignored me, turned, still laughing, and rushed from the restaurant, dragging her pickaxe behind her. ‘SOUL!’ 1 heard her holler. Her laughter still sounded outdoors until a slamming car door ended it.
I paid my bill and, with my wife beside me, headed in the opposite direction.

Ambivalent Patriotism Toward the United States
by Elliott Germain
There is a most unsettling dilemma found within the hearts of many Patriotic Americans emanating from their feelings of Ambivalent Patriotism toward the United States. There is no shame in one saying he is an American, it is an expression of pride, yet when persons within our government assume powers and implement policies contrary to our Constitution, a Patriot may feel a rise of blood pressure and wish to flog the criminal politician. Or when an entire branch of government acts against the liberties of US citizens, such as the murders an entire church a Waco, our patriotism toward the government is left hanging by a thread. The actions of our Federal Government often leave us with adverse feelings of patriotism and disgust.
There is a comparison of this dilemma of mixed patriotism to an example of ambivalence found in family life, or more specifically within a troubled family, with regard to the relationship between a father and his son. The son represents the ‘patriot’ and the father represents the ‘Nation.’ This is a logical comparison since the root word of ‘patriotism’ is the Greek word ‘pater,’ meaning ‘father,’ and the word ‘nation’ being derived from ‘natio’ or ‘by birth’ (natal). The son, by instinct, is loyal to his father. But let’s say that the father
gets drunk sometimes and beats up the son for no reason; the son hates the father’s unjust violation of their relationship. He is loyal to his father, yet he hates his father’s misuse of authority. This is a personal analogy of the Ambivalent Patriotism that many Americans have toward their national government.
Ambivalent Patriotism is no more clearly evident than in the feelings of Americans of Southern descent, i.e. Confederates. Modern Confederates were bom, and grew up in the ‘American Union.’ The flag flying over the nation in which we were bom was the Stars and Stripes. If we go to a foreign land and are asked ‘What country are you from’ we say the United States. But when Southerners think of‘home’ we think of ‘Our State,’ then the ‘South’ and then the entire ‘United States.’ We are patriotic to all three, each for different reasons. A major consideration is that Southerners who identify with their Confederate heritage -do study history- and in doing so understand the true history of, and association between, these three jurisdictions which compete for our patriotism.
A person bom in Virginia is loyal to Virginia. He studies the history of his state and learns that it had entered into a compact with twelve other states to form a mutual government that was to resolve political problems relating to the interactions within this confederation of states; that government was called the United States. The confederated government was accused by the State of Virginia of assuming powers not granted to it in the compact. Other Southern States came to that same conclusion, which led to their secession
from the original government and into the formation of a new confederated government. This created a new patriotism, to the Confederate States of America. The American dream has flourished in each of the three governments: Virginia, the United States and the Confederate States, but things change. But people have had adapt to preserve liberty or see it vanish.
The United States attacked the Southern States and thus attacked their Confederacy. The Southern States were destroyed, and with it the destruction of its public property and private property to include the loss of life to soldiers and civilians, the debacle of the monetary system, the imposition of a military government and the permanent loss of Constitutional Rights, both State and National. That very same destructive ‘Federal’ government is still in power today and has offered no true account or apology of its actions. How can one love his own State (Virginia) and still love the instrument of its destruction? My patriotism of Virginia is steadfast; my patriotism of the Confederacy (which never surrendered) is unwavering (for ‘they’ never attacked Virginia, but only defended her). And so my patriotism of the United States is ambivalent: I love the America of 1789, but I am repulsed by those who destroyed it, and by those politicians today who assume powers never rightfully delegated to them. Honest patriotism is attracted to that which best serves virtue and liberty, but is repulsed by their destruction, past or present.

TechnoFascism
by Thomas H. Naylor
Most Americans think fascism was snuffed out in World War II and that Soviet-like authoritarianism is dead in the water. Nothing could be further from the truth. Our nation has managed to replicate many of the more onerous aspects of both systems-always in the name of freedom. What has emerged is technofascism-a form of government in which huge private corporations through money, markets, and technology control most political, economic, cultural, educational, religious, and social activities.
During World War II Germany, Italy, and Japan were ruled respectively by fascist dictators Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini, and Hideki Tojo. The Soviet Union was run by 250,000 or so self-perpetuating elites who controlled the Communist Party, the KGB, and the military. In our country CEOs of several dozen global, high-tech megacompanies and a handful of international financiers play a similar role.
During the Cold War our politicians ridiculed Soviet planners. But through sophisticated, high-tech media manipulation, the high priests of Corporate America tell us what to buy, when to buy it, where to buy it, how much to pay for it, and when to replace it. We call this free enterprise.
Not unlike the former Communist Party in Moscow, large American companies are among the least-democratic institutions in the world. They do everything possible to silence dissent and quell behaviour differing significantly from the corporate norm.
There are no rights to freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom of the press, or due process. One can be fired on the spot at the whim of one’s supervisor.
Most influential American daily newspapers as well as the five major television networks are owned by huge conglomerates. At the apex of Soviet power, it’s hard to imagine communist propaganda ever being more effective than American television networks in supporting President George Bush’s 1991 invasion of Iraq. CNN provided viewers live coverage of the Middle East equivalent of ‘cowboys and Indians.' Americans were mesmerized by the one-sided patriotic hype.
The World War II Axis powers each had single-party governments as did the Soviet Union until 1991. Today multiple parties are a fact of life nearly everywhere! The only exceptions are the US and a handful of military dictatorships.
The US has a single political party masked as a two-party system. Both parties are firmly entrenched in the centralist camp — committed to making us all the same. The Democrats like big cities, big public works projects, and big social welfare programs; the Republicans big business, big military, and big prisons. Big-name politicians, big political parties, big technology, and the Internet all promote sameness in our sheeplike population. Most Americans think alike, vote the same, watch the same television programs, and buy the same plastic yuck. While pretending Jo be superindividuaiists, most are world-class conformists marching in lock step to the beat of
the same drummers.
During the Cold War Soviet Refuseniks were often jailed. We don’t imprison political dissidents in this country. It’s unnecessary. So powerful is the message from Main Street that those few who disagree are effectively marginalised and relegated to the political sidelines.
European fascists persecuted foreigners and minorities. Technofascists only exploit them. Poorly educated minorities are necessary to do our minimum-wage dirty work. Well educated foreign immigrants hold wage rates down in high-tech industries. Both croups help keep organized labour at bay.
The purpose of education is to train our kids to compete with the Japanese. Longer school days, year round schooling, school uniforms, no recess, national standards and testing, and state controlled megaschools are all part of the drill-just like the former Soviet Union.
To prepare our kids for life in the high-tech fast lane, IBM and Microsoft have launched a propaganda blitz to convince us that our low-tech schools must be computerized and every classroom connected to the Internet. Employing intimidation tactics similar to those used by the Pentagon to sell new weapon systems, these high-tech predators prey on parental fears that their kids may become competitively disadvantaged.
Microsoft may soon be in a position to collect a fee ‘from every airline ticket you buy, every credit card purchase you make, every fax you send, every picture you download, every Web site you visit,’ said James
Gleik in The New York Times. We need not ever leave our lonely, isolated homes even to work, play, shop, worship, exercise, or make love. We can do it all alone in front of our computer screen.
Just as the Nazis sought to create a master race, so too are technofascists drawn to genetic engineering to clone humans to meet the market demand for people possessing specific predetermined properties. Whether one is allocated to die may soon depend primarily on the market. So long as there is demand for your services, then you will be kept alive by high-tech medicine. But if there is no market for your talents, then nature will be allowed to take its course.
With nearly two million people in prison and over three thousand awaiting execution, the aim of our criminal justice system is to protect Corporate America from its own byproducts-poverty, injustice, crime, substance abuse, violence, etc. The Pentagon makes the world safe for giant transnational companies.
Like experimental rats on an electric floor after experiencing learned helplessness from repeated shocks, many Americans sit silently and motionless on the sidelines as though frozen in time. We have abdicated control of our lives to big business, big government, big cities, big schools, and big computer networks. We no longer remember how to take care of ourselves.
So effective were Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher in convincing Governments to decentralize, to deregulate, to rein in organised labour, and to privatize public enterprises that
transnational megacompanies have virtually a free hand to operate globally with little interference from government or labour. They play off one country against the other in pursuit of low-wage, tax-free regulation-free manufacturing environments. In this ‘anything goes’ world, megacom-panies are accountable to no one, since few governments possess the political clout to intervene in the global marketplace and make it stick. Unfettered capitalism is the order of the day.
The geopolitical warlords of the twenty-first century are neither heads of states nor generals but rather multinational CEOs and international money managers. To achieve their ambitious goals, these global
corporate cowboys need never engage in violence, bloodshed, or conventional warfare. They have no need for tanks, submarines, nuclear weapons, stealth bombers, or sophisticated antiballistic missile systems. They make John D. Rockefeller, Andrew Carnegie, and Henrv Ford look like neophytes.
