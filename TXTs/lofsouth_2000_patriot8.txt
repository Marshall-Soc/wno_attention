ELECTION 2000: TIME FOR A DIVORCE BETWEEN MADONNA AND MERLE
As I watched the national election results coming in on the evening of 7 November, I heard one of the countless TV pundits remark that the ‘country music* states were all going for Bush. After looking closely at the electoral map— Red for Bush, Blue for Gore—I couldn’t help noticing that this fellow was right on the money. I also ascertained that the ‘Madonna-MTV’ states were lining up solidly for Gore. In light of the closeness of the tally and the subsequent crisis it has produced, I think it’s time to seriously talk of a divorce between Merle Haggard and Madonna. The same house can’t hold them any longer. Let me explain why.
Now, we know that, as Alabama Governor George C. Wallace once said, there's not a dime’s worth of difference between the jackasses and pachyderms; however, most Americans who voted in this recent election apparently still think that there is enough difference between the Democrats and Republicans to warrant a long wait in line to cast a ballot. And in this case, perception may be as important as reality.
Generally speaking, most Americans (including Southerners) still equate ‘conservative’ with ‘Republican’ and ‘liberal’ with ‘Democrat.’ Voting on that assumption (and a faulty assumption it is), the voters told us much. On the one hand, the ‘conservative’ Bush carried the ‘fly-over’” states, in whose dark and dangerous recesses dwell the majority of the common folks who still revere ‘God, Guts, and Guns,’ much to the dismay of their social and cultural betters in Hollywood and Manhattan. This includes the Deep South, the Upper South, Texas, some of the Midwestern states with a Copperhead and agrarian tradition (Ohio and Indiana), and the Mountain and Great Plains states of the west. On the other hand. Gore carried the elitist states of New England (excluding New Hampshire), New York, Pennsylvania, the Maryland-DC area, some of the old line liberal-populist states such as Minnesota and Iowa, heavily unionized Michigan, and the Left Coast fruit and nut satrapies of California and Washington state.
As I write, the whole issue hangs in the balance in Florida. What we have here is a microcosm of what transpired nationwide. There is no longer one Florida; rather, there are now several, based on a demographic trend that has transformed south Florida into a bastion controlled largely by Latinos and transplanted Yankees, both Jew and Gentile. Much of the Gulf Coast northward to Tampa-St Petersburg remains traditionally conservative, but the truly Southern areas are found from Pensacola eastward across the Panhandle to Jacksonville in the east and southward through the orange groves to Orlando (excepting only the liberal fever swamps of Tallahassee and Gainesville). Florida turned
out to be the battleground state simply because of its demographic diversity.
Even the usually imperceptive national pundits were sharp enough to catch the meaning of the colors on both the national and Florida state maps on Tuesday evening. Several talking heads noted that a ‘culture war’ was being waged in this election. What becomes clear by looking at the electoral map is that there indeed are two well-defined sides widely divided by worldviews. The question begs itself: How long can a shaky peace between them hold? In such a close and hotly contested race, neither side’s supporters arc likely to accept defeat graciously. It is now evident that glaring irregularities and outright voter fraud was rampant all across the country. Now, both sides threaten more recounts and lawsuits that will gum up the process further for weeks or even months. Perhaps the entire system will be brought crashing down. Out of all this confusion one salient fact shines through: the American Empire can no longer manage its affairs in an orderly manner. For that reason, it should be dismantled as soon as possible.
In a recent editorial, syndicated columnist Walter Williams observed that there are basically two sorts of folks in America today: those who wish to be left alone and those who wish to
tell everyone else how to live. Putting 0
aside the real natures of the Democrat and Republican parties (they both are secular, centralizing organizations who sec salvation in power politics), the Bush voters generally fall into the first category and the Gore supporters into
the second. Moreover, the Bush constituency is mainly made up of white European stock that favors gun ownership, Christian morality, less government, fewer programs for minority ‘victim’ groups, and a strict interpretation of the Constitution. The Gore constituency—the elites and their various minority clients—favor gun control, big government, more programs, high taxes, the normalization of deviant behavior, a secular notion of human rights, and a very loose construction of a living and evolving Constitution. In other words, they are polar opposites in many respects. There is no room for compromise.
Would not a friendly separation now be preferable to a bloody conflict later? It is past time that Merle and Madonna part company.

'Peace on Earth, Good Will Toward Men' is part of the Christian message borrowed by secularists and abused as a slogan in their 'smiley faced,’ 'man-is-the-measure ’ religion. May I remind you that this message of peace came originally from the living God, who provided for the propitiation of His wrath against us through the birth, death, and resurrection of his son, Jesus Christ. It is HIS good will toward men that establishes peace, and THIS is what Christians celebrate at Christmas. May you and yours know this peace, which alone makes possible peace among men. Merry Christmas!

GEORGIA
The NAACP flag fight that began in South Carolina has made its way to Georgia. The Coalition to Change the State Flag, meeting in Fitzgerald in mid-November, called for the current state flag to be retired to museums and archives.
The Coalition, made up of a dozen or so ‘civil rights’ organisations, has worked unsuccessfully for years to change the Georgia flag; however, they now are encouraged by the recent removal of the St Andrew’s cross from the South Carolina capitol. State Representative Tyrone Brooks (D-Atlanta) said that ‘if [the flag issue) is not dealt
with in 2001, I do know that the national civil rights community will be calling for national economic sanctions and boycotts.’ Brooks estimated that a boycott of Georgia by the NAACP and its allies could cost the state over ten times what it cost tourism in neighbouring South Carolina. But South Carolina tourism officials have admitted that the much-ballyhooed boycott there actually resulted in increased revenue from tourists. We expect the same in Georgia. We encourage all Georgians to rally to the defense of their honourable flag and other members to consider Georgia for their next vacation or meeting.

Letter from Maurice Bessinger to His Many Supporters
Dear Friends,
Over the last months we have received over 6,000 emails and letters and uncounted thousands of telephone calls. Most of those came in the first few weeks and my small office staff is simply not capable of responding to that sort of volume. Since we couldn’t answer them all we put these messages aside to be answered at a later date. We still have them categorized (in boxes) and I hope to answer them all at some point when we have additional staff that can do so. There were, by the way, only about 50 negative emails compared to the 6,000 + positive messages.
As I say, thank you all from the bottom of my heart. Those messages of support meant so much to me and to my fellow employees especially when we were being maligned in all the major media, our stores were being vandalized and we were being personally threatened by various thugs.
Our battle began soon after I raised our Confederate flag on July 1 st for the first lime at my headquarters restaurant here in West Columbia. I knew before I did it that the stand I was staking might affect my life, my family and my business, but I did it because I felt it needed to be done. After the defeat we sustained in the South Carolina Legislature when the Confederate flag was removed, I had hoped my individual show of Southern pride might be the beginning of a resurgence of individual pride for all Southerners.
Shortly thereafter I also raised the
South Carolina flag to its proper place of sovereignty and asked our legislators to reconsider the historical fact that our states are sovereign over the federal government and not the other way around. My call to consider the proper place of the now massive federal government was the act that started all the trouble.
A scurrilous newspaper article was then written and published in the largest newspaper in the state. That article completely ignored my constitutional arguments but it introduced the incendiary topics of race
and slavery. That article, concentrating on issues I had not raised, caused the firefight that followed.
To make a long story short, the last four months have been a reign of terror in my life. We are in a battle for survival for our people, our business, and also for our lives. The major print news media has done a poor job of reporting what has happened to us, but that, unfortunately, is now to be expected. The electronic media has done a better job, but that has been too little to really effect our situation.
What has not been reported is a situation that 1 will now tell you about.
There is a reign of terror that is going on, has gone on, and continues to go on, against both me and against all the grocery stores that discontinued my products.
The Wal-Mart and the SAM’S Club stores that first pulled my products
could have quietly taken my products off their shelves il they didn’t want to sell it but they chose to make a public issue of it. They issued press releases to the media and proceeded to tell their customers lies about my products saying that there had been a ‘product recall’ as if something was wrong with my products.
When the Wal-Mart story first broke some of the other chains tried to resist this onslaught of political correctness but they were hit by this reign of terror from militants whom, I believe, are being orchestrated by various action groups. What these militants do is enter the stores, loosen the caps on my sauce and pour the contents on the shelves and floor. In some cases they have broken the bottles. This has been a frequent occurrence.
There have also been bomb threats against some stores. Plus, the lives of
‘For his singular devotion to his Country of South Carolina; for his unwavering patriotism to his Country; for his refusal to bow to the elitists of the American Empire; for his long suffering oppression by multinational American Empire corporations; for his proclamation of self-determination and demand of 10th Amendment guarantees...
-From the Order of the Palmetto Patriot certificate presented to Maurice Bessinger at the LS of South Carolina 1st Annual State Meeting in November.
some store managers and top officials of grocery chains have been threatened. I, of course, have documented the threats on my life and that of my family. None of this has been reported by any of the media despite the fact that they could have easily found out with a little investigative journalism. What most of the reporters in the major media wanted to do, however, was incite this sort of action rather than report it.
This is what America has come to when thugs are both egged on and supported by the media.
To say the least this has all been a shock to me. I have no choice now but to strengthen my resolve and be ever vigilant. I will not be frightened from our course now. This is a fight against the evil forces of Satan and we have to be strong. I have asked God to give me the strength to persevere and endure this fight for freedom and liberty.
Again, I want to thank you for your past support and I ask for your continued support. I also ask that you pray for me and my family and my employees. Please remember that God is on our side and we will win in the end.
Your fellow patriot and brother in Christ,
Maurice

The 2000 Non-Election
The ‘non-election’ of 7 November has prompted the foreign press to turn the tables on the sanctimonious American Empire. The Yankee Empire has commonly criticised the electoral process in other countries, but now the shoe is on the other foot. The Independent in London ran an article headlined: ‘The Disunited States of America.’ A similar story that appeared in the Buenos Aires paper proclaimed: ‘From the Ultimate Empire to a Banana Republic.’
Gianni Riotta, a columnist with La Stampa (Turin), wrote: ‘The most powerful democracy on the planet is now forced to surrender itself to lawyers, like bickering condominium owners.’ Luis Fernando Verissimo of the Jornal do Brasil (Rio de Janeiro) noticed: ‘missing ballot boxes, disoriented voters, a suspect count. In other words, Third World things.’
The League of the South is not the only entity that has proposed secession as a remedy for our current election woes. Among them was Michael Peirce in an article, ‘Considering Secession,’ on www.lewrockwell.com, and Laura Ingraham, a political consultant, in an interview on ‘The O’Reilly Factor.’
In an internet poll on World Net Daily asking what George W. Bush should do, one of the responses, ‘Start a secessionist movement’ had received, as of 22 November, 12% of the votes cast.

Preliminary 2000 Presidential Vote Analysis By Region
contributed by William L Cawthon Athens, Georgia
The preliminary results from the 2000 Presidential race graphically demonstrate once again the sharp differences between the South and the non-South. The South went for Bush by over three and a half million votes; the rest of the U.S. voted for Gore by over 3.7 million votes. The margin for Bush in the South was twelve percentage points (55% to 43%); for Gore in the non-South, six percentage points (51% to 45%), a total spread of eighteen points, a difference approaching landslide proportions. The five States of the Deep South (Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana,
Mississippi, and South Carolina), voted slightly more strongly for Bush (56%) than did the eight Rocky Mountains States (Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming), with a 55% Bush vote.
The Northeast went for Gore by a near landslide (56% to 40%); the West went for Gore by 49% to 47%; only the Midwest, other than the South, went for Bush, but by the slim margin of 49% to 48%. However, Bush carried the Midwest only because the four Great Plains States of Kansas, Nebraska, and the Dakotas are included within that region. These States of the great plains have for decades been voting similarly to the Rocky Mountain States, and so, politically, should be included with the Rocky Mountain region in a new Interior Western region. Likewise, the
Rocky Mountain States politically differ dramatically from the Pacific region, even though both have traditionally been included within the West. Therefore, it is best to view the U.S. as constituting five major political regions—the Northeast, the South, the Midwest, the Interior West, and the Pacific states—rather than the current four of Northeast, Midwest, South and West. In the new regional analysis, only the South and the Interior West voted for Bush, and surprisingly, the Interior West, with relatively few minority voters in most States, went for Bush by only two percentage points greater than did the South (57% to 55%).
The following tables reveal the preliminary results (figures are in thousands);

Rocky Mountain and Great Plains: Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, Wyoming (Rocky Mountain States) plus Kansas, Nebraska, and the Dakotas (Great Plains States) (12 States)
Pacific: Alaska, California, Hawaii, Oregon, and Washington (5 States).
West: the Pacific States plus the Rocky Mountain States (13 States).
North: Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont (the New England States); plus Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, West Virginia (the Middle Atlantic States); plus Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Ohio, and Wisconsin (the revised Midwest) (20 States).
Deep South: Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina (5 States).
Upper South: Arkansas, North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia (4 States).
Rocky Mountain: Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, Wyoming (8 States).
Great Plains: Kansas, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota (4 States).
The above figures were taken from USA Today of 9 November 2000. One hundred percent of the precincts were reported from 21 States, including California; 99% of the precincts were reported from 23 States; two States reported 98% of their precincts; leaving only the States of Vermont (95% of precincts reporting), North Dakota (95%), Oregon (87%) and Alaska (87%), with any substantial number of precincts unreported. The final regional comparisons will differ very little from the results reported above. The exit polling data from the New York Times, in fact, gives an almost identical vote distribution for the four traditional U.S. regions of Northeast (which the Times calls the East), South, Midwest, and West.

LSI Summer School Report & Plans
contributed by Don Livingston Atlanta, Georgia
The Fifth Annual LSI Summer School was held in Beersheba Springs, Tennessee, 25-30 June 2000, on the topic, The Southern Agrarian Tradition.’ It was the best attended summer school we have had, with 42 registering. Students ranged in age from advanced high school to retirees. We were especially pleased to have so many college and graduate students. Students came from the University of South Carolina, Florida State, University of Tennessee, George Mason, Emory, University of Virginia, University of Florida, James Madison, University of the South, Georgia State, the College of Charleston, and Florida Atlantic. Lectures were given by Lee Cheek, Thomas Fleming, Clyde Wilson, Benjamin Alexander, Ted Smith, A. J. Conyers, and Alan Cornett.
In addition to this nationally advertised summer school, two permanent, weekend summer schools were established in Louisiana, 22-24 June, and in Virginia, 27-29 July. Miss Mary Elizabeth Sanders generously hosted the Louisiana summer school in her home in the Garden District of Baton Rouge, and Dr Bill Wilson directed the summer school in Staunton, Virginia. Our long-term goal is to have a permanent summer school in each Southern State. The success of these schools depends upon LS chapters recruiting students and funding their tuition. We very much need your support in this effort. No goal is more important than that of educating our young people.
The Sixth Annual Summer School will be held in Abbeville, South Carolina, 23-28 July 2001, on Total War and Reconstruction.’ Lectures will be given by Thomas DiLorenzo, Michael Hill. Donald Livingston, Clyde Wilson, Thomas Fleming, John Chodes, Roger Busbice, and James Kibler. Topics in-

Secession Now...
The escalating confusion surrounding the 7 November ‘election’ drives home the point that the rule of Constitutional law in America is dead. Pundits on both sides are fond of invoking the importance of the ‘rule of law;’ however, let us not confuse the rule of law with the rule of lawyers. If the next president is crowned by the courts, then we indeed will have succumbed to the rule of lawyers.
While it is still clear that the Gore campaign is engaged in a left-wing coup to steal the election by endless recounts of Democratic counties in Florida, it is equally clear that the Bush campaign has little concern for the supremacy of Florida state law when it doesn’t serve his vote totals. Bush was the first to bring the ‘federal’ courts (i.e. the Supreme Court) into this mess. We say ‘a pox on both your houses.’
What is needed at this moment is for the Florida State Legislature to tell both the State and U.S. Supreme courts that it will determine Florida election law and the legitimacy of Florida’s 25 electors. If the Solons of the Sunshine State do not act, and act soon, they will

eralism itself. The courts must not be allowed to usurp the discretionary authority of the legislative branch, and the ‘federal’ government (through the Supreme Court) must not be permitted to determine the validity of a state’s electoral laws.
Despite the contending claims of the Bush and Gore
camps, something is at stake here

LS/LDA LONG-DISTANCE PLAN:
SAVE MONEY/MAKE MORE MONEY FOR THE LEAGUE
COMMISSION RATE NOW 7 PERCENT
— Businesses can switch over their 800 number and save BIG!
LDA provides long distance services for a host of conservative, Christian, and Southern heritage organisations. LDA will place you with a long distance service that does not support anti-Southern causes. You will be guaranteed a minimum of 10%, 20%, 30% or more in long distance savings, or DOUBLE YOUR MONEY BACK.
In addition, each month LDA will NOW donate 7% of your long distance usage (in the form of a check) to The League of the South.
If you are not happy, they will switch you back at no cost
—	Dial 1 long distance service and easy to use calling cards with no surcharge per call.
—	Six-second incremental billing; pay only for what you use.
—	Not limited to League of the South members. Sign up others and help The League.
—	Generate monthly contributions from LDA to The League of the South to help advance our cause.
Based on a 7% donation from LDA to the League on an average $25.00 monthly residential long distance bill, the League's commission is $20 per average contributor per year— a very conservative projection, since many residential and commercial monthly long distance bills are much larger than $25.00.
With 400 LDA sign-ups, the monthly commission to the League would be $670.00 and the annual commission $8,000. Please consider switching your long distance carrier to LDA Call David Williams at (800) 535-0757 for more info or to sign up.

be a matter decided by Floridians according to the rule of Florida State law, as determined by the legislature. Coercion by the courts is no different in principle from coercion by armed forces.
This entire election scam ought to make one thing crystal clear: the viability of secession as a political option. When lawyers and judges are called upon to divine the will of the people of a state, then we have reached the point where radical solutions have become necessary.
Please do not look on helplessly. Talk and write about secession incessantly. Neither candidate promises any solutions to our fundamental problems.
