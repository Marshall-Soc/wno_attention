"Some call it Marxism - I call it Judaism."
— Rabbi Stephen S. Wise The American Bulletin May 15,1935
By now you all know about the “rescue** of the Jews from
Ethiopia. As you read the Associated Press story on this
page, keep in mind that less than the whole truth is
included in the story.	,	, .

ALBERT If A TRIBUNE, Sunday. Moy 26, 1991-
The first question that might be asked is why these 15,000 7ews had to be plucked to'safety? Our lead quote by Rabbi Wise answers the question completely. Ethiopia has been ruled by a Marxist regime led by Mengistu Haile Mariam for 17 years. Civil war has raged for years to oust this repressive Marxist regime. When the victory of the so-called rebels became inevitable, Mariam resigned and fled to Zimbabwe (another Marxist enclave). Now it is important to keep in mind that no ruling regime maintains control by one man. Who were the people who helped Mengistu Haile Mariam solidify his Marxist regime? Obviously, it was the people who had to be “rescued** from the so-called rebels. It follows that these Jews were in grave danger of reprisals, and in time, possibly being tried for war crimes which will no doubt come to light after the “rebel*' victory.
In as much as Marxism and Judaism are twin sisters, as Rabbi Wise has stated, it is now understandable why the Jews arc forced to flee
a Marxist country as soon as their political clout is reversed.
Another portion of the Associated Press story that 'will no doubt create a few chuckles is the statement that the Ethiopian Jews are — “held to be the descendants of one of the 10 lost tribes of Israel.” One wonders who holds such a belief in light of God’s injunctions on interracial marriage, and which “tribe" supposedly entertained tho proverbial ‘nigger in the woodpile.* Pcrhaps,one of our readers will enlighten us.
The last bit of half-truth regarding this story comes from the NBC Nightly News. They reported that non-Black Jews already in Israel are “adopting" the Black newcomers. Unless there has been a dramatic change within the non-Black Jewish community in Israeli occupied Palestine, the “adopting" probably means that Black newcomers are now domestic servants or farm laborers of the non-Black Jews. Aha, perhaps we now know why the Israelis are so pleased with the new arrivals. The way the Palestinians have been acting lately with their uprising, it must be nice to be receiving some non-aggressive servants for a change.
The so-called Black Hebrews have always been “second-class" citizens of the Ashkenazi Jews according to journalist Leon Dobbs of the African Hebrew Israelite Community. Mr. Dobbs* reports of the Israeli exploitation of his people have been reported in the SPOTLIGHT over the years.
Now you know The Rest Of The^tory.
