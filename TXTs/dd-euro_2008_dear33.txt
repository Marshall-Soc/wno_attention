Dear f-
Barack Hussein Obama has a good chance of becoming the 44th President of die United States.
Who is Obama? He is a far-left Black radical who has a deep hatred of White America.
Obama spent 20 years in an extreme Black racist church in Chicago that proclaims its loyalty to Africa rather than America. Obama's spiritual adviser and closest friend believes in so called "Black Liberation Theology." Here's a quote about it from the Washington Post, April 1,2008:
The church where Sen. Barack Obama has worshiped for two decades publicly declares that its ministry is founded on a 1960s book that espouses "the destruction of the white enemy."
Trinity United Church of Christ's Web site says its teachings are based on the black liberation theology of James H. Cone and his 1969 book "Black Theology and Black Power."
"What we need is the divine love as expressed in Black Power, which is the power of black people to destroy their oppressors here and now by any means at their disposal. Unless God is participating in this holy activity, we must reject his love," Mr. Cone wrote in the book.
Mr. Cone, a professor at the Union Theological Seminary in New York, added that "black theology will accept only the love of God which participates in the destruction of the white enemy."
Obama is close friends of Lou Ayers and Bemardine Dohm, two unrepentant Marxist terrorist bombers who state that they wish they had placed more bombs.
Obama can believe whatever he wants to believe, but should he become President of the United States? It sounds to me that he should be running of perhaps Uganda, but not the USA!
This Duke Report Obama special issue is perhaps one of the most important I ever wrote.
The one bright spot in the Obama candidacy is that never has it become more clear to White Americans how we have lost control of our country that the time has come for us to stand up.
No issue in the last few decades has more potential to wake up and motivate our people.
I hope you can give us the means to do that through the most generous contribution you have ever given. Please help me take this vital message to the American people.

A gift of $100, $500, or even $1000 would help our efforts greatly. Mr. Andrews, I appreciate anything you can do to help —
Help us expose Obama and wake up * European Americans!
Obama is, of course, a catastrophe for the United States of America and the European American people that created our nation, our traditions, our values and our freedoms.
McCain is in some ways worse in that he has clearly betrayed our people in the U.S. Senate by supporting amnesty for illegal
aliens and he is completely servile to Israel, probably even more than George Bush!
The bright side of this bleak picture is that Obama is now a very loud wake up call for our people. I have never seen such powerful reaction in our people. They are flocking to our ranks in response. Please help me seize this opportunity!
