The following is a resume of those things we believe and teach from the Holy Scriptures. This list is by no means complete, but we feel it will be of help to those wishing to make a study of the Scripture as it relates to the individual, the nation, and the world in the end of this age.
We believe in the God of the Bible (Ex. 3:6-15).
We believe that the Holy Bible, as accepted by Classical Protestantism, is the only Word of God (2 Tim. 3:16; 2 Pet. 1:21).
We believe in the Bible account of creation (Gen. 1), and that Adam originated from the dust of the earth (Gen. 2:7).
We believe that Jesus Christ was the Creator of all (Col. 1:12-20), was the Word made flesh (John 1:1-3, 14), and was manifested to Israel in this age when born of a virgin (Is. 7:14; Matt, 1:18-23).
We believe that sin is the transgression of God’s Law (1 John 3:4); that all have sinned (Rom. 3:23); that death (cessation of life) is the penalty for sin (Rom. 6:23; James 1:15); that God has imputed Adam’s sin to all men, thus making all mortal and corruptible (Rom. 5:12-14); that Christ alone has immortality (1 Tim. 6:16); and that God will likewise impute the righteousness of Christ to all men (Rom. 5:15-19).
We believe in the resurrection of the dead as prophesied (Job 19:25-27; Hosea 13:13, 14; John 5:29); as taught in the Scripture (Matt: 28:1-6; Acts 24:14, 15; 1 Cor. 15:11-26; 1 Pet. 1:3); and that those who obtain the first resurrection will reign with Christ during the Kingdom Age (2 Tim. 2:11, 12; Rev. 5:10; 20:6),
We believe that Jesus Christ ascended into heaven (Mark 16:19), where He makes intercession
for us as our only High Priest (Heb. 7:24, 25); and that He shall personally return (Zech. 14:4; Acts 1:9-14), take the Throne of David (Is. 9:6, 7; Luke 1:32, 33), and rule on earth over all kindreds and tongues (Is. 11:9; 61-11; Dan. 2:44; Acts 3:21; Rev. 11:15).
We believe that the Holy Spirit was given to us in Christ’s absence to testify of Christ, to lead men into the truth, and to convict the world of sin, righteousness, and judgment (John 15:26; 16:7-14).
We believe that Justification is in Christ and in His finished work, wholly outside of ourselves (Rom. 3:24); that it is the gift of God, not of works (Eph. 2:8, 9); and that our acceptance of and belief in Christ’s work is necessary to qualify us for resurrection to immortality (Phil. 3:11-15).
We believe in water baptism by immersion, in which the believer identifies himself with Christ’s death, burial, and resurrection, as a testimony to his repentance from sin and his commitment to walk in newness of life in obedience to God’s Law (Matt. 3:13-15; Rom. 6:3-5; Acts 2:37-39).
We believe in the ordinance of communion, as established by Jesus Christ (Matt: 26:26-29; 1 Cor. 10:16).
We believe that God chose the descendants of Abraham (Is. 44:1, 2), through Isaac and Jacob alone (Rom. 9:7), to be a special people unto Himself (Deut. 7:6); that God and Israel bound themselves by Law in a marriage contract at Mt. Sinai (Ex. 19); and that this contract was conditional upon Israel’s fulfillment of her vow to follow God’s Laws, statutes, and judgments | (Ex. 19:5).
We believe that God’s Law was given only to Israel (Deut: 33:4); that it was given for Israel’s good (Deut. 5:33), but that Israel was to be punished, if it was disregarded (Deut. 28); and that this Law eventually was to be administered to the entire world (Is. 2:3; Rev. 21:24).
We believe that non-Israelite people can come under the Israel covenants through faith and obedience to the Law (Ex. 12:49; Is. 56:6-8; Acts 10; John 3:16, 17).
We believe that God divorced Israel for her violation of the marriage contract (Jer. 3:8); that the House of Israel was cast out of the old land (2 Kings 17:23); but that while Israel was in “the wilderness,” God would again betroth her to Himself (Hos. 2:14-19) and give her a new land (2 Sam. 7:10).
We believe that the New Covenant was made with Israel (Jer. 31:31-34; Heb. 8:8-12); that Jesus came to confirm that Covenant (Mai. 3:1; Rom. 15:8) and redeem Israel (Luke 1:30-33; Luke 24:21); and that Jesus Christ’s death and resurrection enabled Him legally to remarry His former wife, Israel (Deut. 24:1-4; 1 Cor. 7:39; Rom. 7:1-4).
We believe that Israel was to lose her old name (Is. 62:2; Hos. 2:17); that she was to be called by God’s Name (Num. 6:27; Rev. 3:12); and that this was fulfilled when God began to call Israelites “Christians” (Acts 11:26).
We believe that the “satan” or “devil” of the Bible is an “adversary” and in most cases is representative of man’s own lusts (James 1:13-15), his own “flesh” (James 4:1-7), his wicked heart (Jer. 17:9-10); and that there are people who are so under the control of this “adversary” that they will not hear God (John 8:44-77).
We believe that Jesus Christ has broken the power of the biblical “satan” (Heb. 2:14), and that His Name makes devils impotent against Christians (Luke 10:17).
We believe that the “last battle” is being fought between the Israel of God and the enemies of Jesus Christ (Rev. 16:13, 14; Zeph. 3:8), and that Jesus Christ is the victor in this battle (Is. 28:21, 22; 45:17-25; Ez. 38, 39; Hos. 13, 14; Joel 3:9-21; Micah 7:16-20; Zech. 14:9; Mai. 4; Matt. 28:18; Luke 19:27; 1 Cor. 15:24-28; Phil. 2:9-11; 2 Pet. 3:7-13; Rev. 11:18; 15:4; 19:11-16, and others).
CONCLUSION
We believe that a prayerful study of the Bible and a general knowledge of World History provides convincing proof that the Anglo-Saxon, Celtic, Scandinavian, Germanic, and related peoples, often called “the Christian nations,” are the racial descendants of the tribes of Israel.
We believe that Prophecy about Israel has been, is being, and will continue to be, fulfilled in them. As the true Israel of God they come under all the Covenants, Prophecies, and Promises that God made with Israel and which Christ came to confirm.
Only these people have the Bible, believe in Jesus Christ, call on His Name, are called by His Name, have used His Laws for their Civil Governments, establish a weekly Sabbath by law, carry His Word to the other Races of the earth, and are now the object of a world-wide attack by the enemies of Jesus Christ who are organizing all the heathen under the Red banner of Anti-Christ World Communism.
We especially believe that the United States of America and Canada uniquely fulfill the prophesied place of the regathering of all the tribes of the Israel of God.
We further believe that the people of true Israel will recognize their identity and turn to the Lord Jesus Christ and call upon Him for Salvation and Redemption, and that they will be delivered from their enemies in the “last battle” which will destroy the wicked and will usher in the great Kingdom Age upon the earth.
RESOLVE
We hereby resolve, before Almighty God and in the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ that we will preach and teach these truths and all of the Truths of the Holy Scriptures so help us God.
